      <p>This study is a key output from the  GDHRNet (Global Digital Human Rights Network), which is dedicated to the investigation of theoretical and practical challenges of the protection of human rights in the digital context.</p>
<p>It is presented as part one of two outlining key outputs from common research efforts, and  aims to establish standards and recommendations for online intermediaries to assess their compliance with human rights obligations. The research is based on a questionnaire distributed to GDHRNet members, with responses from nine participants representing both EU and non-EU countries.</p>
<p>The findings underscore the centrality of the Digital Services Act (DSA) in European platform regulation, alongside other relevant EU legislative acts such as the GDPR and the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. The study highlights the influence of EU legislation on national laws, including in non-EU states, and the pervasive “Brussels Effect” shaping legal framework. The study briefly explores the DSA’s provisions, including liability exemptions, obligations related to terms of service, transparency requirements, and regulations on algorithmic recommender systems. It provides an overview of the current regulatory landscape, emphasizing the importance of harmonizing platform regulations with human rights obligations across both EU and non-EU countries.</p>

<li>The DSA is at the heart of European platform regulation. However, they are not the only legislative Act that platforms have to consider when conducting their respective business. Several EU legislative acts apply to platforms (just to mention a few: the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the General Data Protection Regulation, the E-Commerce-Directive, or the DSM Directive). National legislation is heavily influenced by EU legislation. Especially the reports on non-EU member states show the relevance of mere national legislation which is however partly influenced by EU regulation through the “Brussels Effect”.</li>

    <p>As a European regulation, the DSA is directly applicable in the member states of the European Union (EU member states) and therefore no national implementation is required. According to Article 2 of the DSA the connecting factor for the application of the DSA is not the place of establishment or location of the intermediary services but of the recipients of the services of the intermediary services. Among the surveyed countries surveyed, 7 of them are EU member states. Consequently, platforms offering services in these countries have to adhere to the requirements stipulated by the DSA.</p>

    <p>The Working Papers of the <a href="https://gdhrnet.eu/">Global Digital Human Rights Network</a> – edited by Mart Susi and Matthias C. Kettemann – addresses both idealistic as well as practice-oriented dimensions of the field. Scholars working with digital human rights have for some time realized that in the digital domain of human rights theory matters less and technical solutions matter more. The Working Paper series questions this approach and, through empirical studies and dogmatic analysis, provide best practice models for the protection of human rights in times of powerful private actors and digital challenges to individual freedoms and social cohesion.</p>

The network will address whether international human rights law is sufficiently detailed to enable governments and private online companies to understand their respective obligations vis-à-vis human rights protection online. It will evaluate how national governments have responded to the task of providing a regulatory framework for online companies and how these companies have transposed the obligation to protect human rights and combat hate speech online into their community standards. The matters of transparency and accountability will be explored, through the lens of corporate social responsibility. </p>
