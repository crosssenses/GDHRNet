abstract:               "This comparative study looks into the proposed “vaccine passport” initiative from various human rights aspects. The findings are based on responses to questions put to the network members by the authors of this study in February 2021 (questions attached in Annex I). We acknowledge individual contributions from colleagues (listed in the table of contributors above), whose views are sometimes presented in a generalised fashion.\n\n

The study concentrated on the availability of a legal framework for the
proposed “vaccine passport”, whether such a “passport” would create
binding obligations in the public and private sectors or, alternatively,
what would be the scope of discretion allowed to public and private
entities to make their decisions affecting rights holders’ access to
various services.\n\n
