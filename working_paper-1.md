**EU COST Action – CA19143: Global Digital Human Rights Network **

The GDHRNet COST Action will systematically explore the theoretical and
practical challenges posed by the online context to the protection of
human rights. The network will address whether international human
rights law is sufficiently detailed to enable governments and private
online companies to understand their respective obligations vis-à-vis
human rights protection online. It will evaluate how national
governments have responded to the task of providing a regulatory
framework for online companies and how these companies have transposed
the obligation to protect human rights and combat hate speech online
into their community standards. The matters of transparency and
accountability will be explored, through the lens of corporate social
responsibility.

The Action will propose a comprehensive system of human rights
protection online, in the form of recommendations of the content
assessment obligation by online companies, directed to the companies
themselves, European and international policy organs, governments and
the general public. The Action will also develop a model which minimizes
the risk of arbitrary assessment of online content and instead
solidifies standards which are used during content assessment; and
maximizes the transparency of the outcome.

The Action will achieve scientific breakthroughs (a) by means of a
quantitative and qualitative assessment of whether private Internet
companies provide sufficient protection of human rights online in
comparison with judicial institutions, (b) in the form of a novel
holistic theoretical approach to the potential role of artificial
intelligence in protecting human rights online, and (c) by providing
policy suggestions for private balancing of fundamental rights online.

GDHRNet is a member of

**Network of COST Actions on COVID-19 and other pandemics**

Very early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, COST Actions started to
collaborate with other Actions on COVID-19 and on the impact of
pandemics in general. In order to coordinate these efforts, COST has
gathered details of all of the Actions wishing to connect and
collaborate. All the information can be found in the booklet “COST
Actions against COVID-19 – An interdisciplinary network”
([https://www.cost.eu/who-we-are/about-cost/coronavirus-covid-19](https://www.cost.eu/who-we-are/about-cost/coronavirus-covid-19/)).

 

As the full consequences of the current pandemic are yet unknown and the
threat of a future pandemic is always present, the Network of Actions
offers considerable potential in mobilising experts and tackling
challenges as they arise. The Network is open to other participants and
completely bottom-up. Any Actions wishing to join it can do so by
contacting the COST Science Officer coordinating this initiative.

Foreword to the Working Paper Series
====================================

The Working Papers of the Global Digital Human Rights Network contain
both an idealistic and a practice-oriented dimension. It is often
difficult but always unavoidable for academia to reach out to the “real
world”. Scholars working with digital human rights have for some time
realized that in the digital domain of human rights theory matters less
and technical solutions matter more. The Working Paper series, again
idealistically, attempt to reverse this pattern. The level of this
goal’s pragmatism depends on the Network’s capability to break or at
least question the strengthening grip of the online companies as
powerful actors in defining the image of human rights in the digital
landscape.

The current inaugural edition clearly shows how turbulent times
accelerate the solidification of the novel “digital paradigm” in human
rights protection. What during ordinary times could have taken decades
may show itself as an important trend within a brief time due to the
pandemic crisis. This means “normalization” of features which previously
were considered contestable. For example, absence of transparency and
foreseeability as inherent charac­teristics of private content
governance has long been tacitly accepted because of the focus shift
from the content assessment process to the outcome. But during difficult
times, people expect answers and justification for decisions that impact
how they can communicate.

The pandemic crisis has turned private platforms into even more powerful
actors that largely set speech standards freely. Operation models of
content governance are sometimes at odds with human rights principles
developed by courts in and for the offline domain. This study saliently
shows how the increased role of private platforms in crisis
communication translates into daily decisions on what to delete and what
not to delete. In doing so, platforms have become essential
communicative actors in pandemic times. But do they enjoy the same level
of legitimacy? How have they acted in different countries? What is their
relation to states? Edited by Matthias C. Kettemann and Martin Fertmann
at the Leibniz Institute for Media Research and based on submissions by
COST Action participants from 20 countries, this first paper sets out to
find answers. Many more will follow throughout the life-time of the COST
Action.

Executive Summary
=================

-   This study explores the spread of disinformation relating to the
    > Covid-19 pandemic on the internet, dubbed by some as the
    > pandemic’s accompanying “infodemic,” and the societal reactions to
    > this development across different countries and platforms. The
    > study’s focus is on the role of states and platforms in combatting
    > online disinformation.

-   Through synthesizing answers to questions submitted by more than 40
    > researchers from 20 countries within the GDHR Network, this
    > exploratory study provides a first overview of how states and
    > platforms have dealt with Corona-related disinformation. This can
    > also provide incentives for further rigorous studies of
    > disinformation governance standards and their impact across
    > different socio-cultural environments.

-   Regarding the platforms’ willingness and efficacy in removing
    > (presumed) disinformation, a majority of submissions identifies a
    > shift towards more intervention in pandemic times. Most submitters
    > assess that this shift is widely welcomed in their respective
    > countries and more often considered as taking place too slowly
    > (rather than being perceived as entailing dangers for unjustified
    > restrictions of freedom of expression). The picture is less clear
    > when it comes to enforcing non-speech related infection prevention
    > measures.

-   While the dominant platforms have been able to defend, or even
    > solidify, their position during the pandemic, communicative
    > practices on those platforms are changing. For officials, this
    > includes an increasing reliance on platforms, especially social
    > networks, for communicating infection prevention rules and
    > recommendations. For civil society, the pandemic has brought an
    > increasing readiness – and perceived need – to intervene against
    > disinformation, especially through fact-checking initiatives.

-   National and local contexts show great variance at whether
    > platform-driven disinformation is conceived as a societal problem.
    > In countries where official sources are distrusted and/or seen as
    > disseminating disinformation criticism against private information
    > governance by platforms remains muted. In countries where official
    > sources are trusted disinformation present on platforms is seen
    > more negatively.

-   While Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram play important roles in the
    > pandemic communication environment, some replies point towards an
    > increasing importance of messaging apps for the circulation of
    > Covid-19-related disinformation. These apps, like Telegram or
    > WhatsApp, tend to fall under the radar of researchers, because
    > visibility of content is limited and scraping is difficult, and
    > because they are not covered by Network Enforcement Act-type laws
    > that usually exclude one-to-one communication platforms (even if
    > they offer one-to-many channels).

-   Vis-à-vis widespread calls for a (re)territorialization of their
    > content governance standards and processes amid the pandemic,
    > platform companies have maintained, by and large, global
    > standards. Standardized, featured sections for national (health)
    > authorities to distribute official information via platforms are
    > exceptions thereto.

**Introduction**

While the Covid-19 pandemic has forced schools, many jobs and most
social interactions to go online, the transformative power of online
communication is not a new phenomenon. Already in 2015, the European
Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) noted that the Internet “has now become
one of the principal means by which individuals exercise their right to
freedom to receive and impart information and ideas, providing \[...\]
essential tools for participation in activities and discussions
concerning political issues and issues of general interest.”[^1] A lot
of this communication takes place in online settings that are ruled and
regulated by private companies.

These rules are increasingly sophisticated but continue to be criticized
widely for the opacity of their development, the arbitrariness of their
application, and the non-plausibility of their execution. The general
commitment of private actors to the Ruggie Principles as a “social
license to operate”[^2] often ends when economic questions become
dominant. It is therefore essential to underline states‘ primary
obligation to respect, protect and ensure human rights on and vis-à-vis
private platforms,[^3] coupled with a secondary obligation of companies
to apply local law in light of international human rights standards.[^4]
As one of us put it:

> States have a duty to protect their citizens with regard to the
> internet (and regarding their online activities, including the
> exercise of freedom of expression). Companies, too, have a corporate
> social responsibility to respect human rights within their sphere of
> influence, which – on the internet – is growing rapidly as the
> majority of relevant communicative acts take place in private spaces.
> The special role of intermediaries is another challenge for regulating
> the internet. As the majority of online spaces lie in private hands,
> it is private law that prima facie frames many norm conflicts online.
> When states react belatedly through laws or judgments, these may lead
> to overblocking or legal conflicts between competing jurisdictions.
> This is why states, offline just as online, have both the negative
> obligation to refrain from violating the right to freedom of
> expression and other human rights in the digital environment, and the
> positive obligation to protect human rights and create an enabling and
> safe environment for everyone. Due to the horizontal effects of human
> rights, the positive obligation to protect includes a duty for states
> to protect individuals from the actions of private parties by making
> intermediaries comply with relevant legal and regulatory
> frameworks.[^5]

This duty to protect becomes especially important in pandemic times. The
possible effects of health-related disinformation in a global health
emergency, but also the effects of measures taken to tackle such
disinformation are raising the stakes in the ongoing, and largely
open-ended, discussion. How and by whom should rules for online
communication be formulated and enforced?

**The study**

How can we as researchers navigate the plethora of platforms, governance
approaches, disinformation narratives and the respective societal
contexts in such a volatile situation? We are convinced that this can
only be achieved through collective scientific action. This study may
therefore function as a proof of concept.

This study explores the spread of disinformation relating to the
Covid-19 pandemic on the Internet, dubbed by some as the pandemic’s
accompanying “infodemic,” and the societal reactions to this development
across different countries and platforms. Its focus is on the role of
states and platforms in combatting online disinformation.

Through synthesizing answers to twelve questions submitted by more than
40 researchers about 20 countries within the GDHR Network, this
exploratory study provides a first overview of how states and platforms
have dealt with Corona-related disinformation. This can also provide
incentives for further rigorous studies of disinformation governance
standards and their impact across different socio-cultural environments.

The individual submissions within this study are not intended to
function as stand-alone, comprehensive assessments of the respective
country. Rather, they function as pixels that collectively constitute a
picture of the Covid-19 disinformation landscape.[^6]

**The results**

The initial situation in terms of the popularity of digital platforms in
the surveyed countries offers a largely homogenous picture: in almost
all responses, Facebook and YouTube belong to the top five, accompanied
mostly by Instagram and Twitter and sometimes by Pinterest and LinkedIn.
The search engine Google and the messaging service WhatsApp are
mentioned less often, but if so, they rank first or second on the list
of platforms.[^7] This finding most likely hints at different
definitions of the term “platform,” which in some instances appears to
refer to social media services, while in other cases content
intermediaries like Google and messaging services like WhatsApp are
included as well. For supposedly similar reasons, popular national and
regional news sites[^8] as popular websites and “platforms for content”
appear on some countries’ top lists.

Said differentiation between (social media) platforms and messaging
services appears to play an even more important role with regard to the
spread of Corona-related (dis)information.[^9] While Facebook and, to a
slightly lesser extent, Twitter, Instagram and other popular platforms
are nearly always mentioned as a spreading medium, some replies
explicitly point towards an increasing importance of messaging apps in
circulating Covid-related disinformation.[^10] One report explicitly
mentions the increasing practice of “chain-messaging via Viber and
WhatsApp platforms, with disinformation about various aspects of the
pandemic.”[^11] Adding to this, a reference from Israel argues that in
the country “WhatsApp's groups are more dangerous in this time than
public platforms such as Twitter, \[as\] the spreader identity provides
credibility to the message delivered.”[^12] This is in line with a
(non-representative) inquiry from Germany, arguing that the
disinformation is published on content platforms like YouTube and spread
via messaging or social networks like WhatsApp and Facebook.[^13]

In terms of distribution channels, several submissions have also shown a
shift from social networks towards – in terms of measures against
disinformation – more lenient, if not indifferent, messaging services
like Telegram and Viber.[^14] It could be argued that groups/channels on
such messaging platforms are on the rise as adversary (and
non-observable) public fora internationally. This international notion
also includes the *transnational* spread of certain disinformation,
especially due to the common Russian language proficiency in Eastern
Europe, as the example of Latvia shows: its submission details that
“several fake news have also been distributed in Russian or have been
translated from this language”.[^15]

The reported counter-measures against such disinformation generally
belong to one of two categories: the first one concerns the platforms’
own efforts to counter disinformation, e.g. labels for potentially
harmful, misleading information on Twitter;[^16] Covid-19-related
content moderation rules on YouTube;[^17] a WHO chat bot on
WhatsApp;[^18] and increased content moderation in cooperation with
third-party fact-checkers on Facebook[^19]. Those measures, however, are
not country-specific and (apparently step-by-step[^20]) applied without
significant national differences – if differences in language and
cooperating fact-checking organizations are left aside.[^21] Of all
surveyed countries, only South Africa appears to be an exception here,
as “misinformation is removed in response to public outrage or the
possibility of criminal prosecution rather than any measures imposed by
the social media platforms themselves.”[^22]

Besides the platforms’ own efforts, there have been notable examples of
*external* initiatives to counter disinformation on platforms. One is a
service to support journalists in verifying social network content: the
platform called “Truly Media” was developed already before the pandemic,
but has recently gained additional traction in Cyprus.[^23] Another
platform-external effort is a new bottom-up initiative to counter
disinformation online: a regional central/south-eastern European
consortium of fact-checking portals created its own public Viber Channel
titled (translation) “Covid-19 Checked”[^24] – thereby entering the area
of direct messaging to counter disinformation. Apart from such single
cases, governments and traditional news media have been named by many
submissions as providers of specific initiatives against disinformation
outside the platforms, but sometimes also as “trusted sources” in
cooperation with social networks.[^25]

In general, governments of all surveyed countries have urged the public
to consume information about Covid-19 in a responsible manner and warned
against the dangers of disinformation in social networks. While in most
countries the administrations’ argument refers to the danger for
individual and public health, some warned against a threat to *public
order* as such.[^26] Beyond the governments’ usual public relations
outreach, several submissions describe the establishment of new
governmental institutions to counter online disinformation during the
pandemic, e.g. an anti-fake-news task-force in Italy or a special team
at the Belgian police to search specifically for Covid-19-related
disinformation.[^27]

When it comes to public comments on the topic by politicians and other
officials, the majority of reported statements include the importance of
a careful handling of Covid-19-related information. However, they do not
elaborate on potential sources for the disinformation. If those are
mentioned, the diagnosis is inconsistent: while some argue there was no
“organized disinformation, rather more emotion-driven circulation of
false information,”[^28] in other cases the involvement of foreign
actors is at least implied.[^29] Similarly inconsistent is their
attribution of responsibility for a proper handling of disinformation.
On the one hand, politicians “expect social networks to live up to their
responsibility,”[^30] on the other hand, they emphasize that “the main
emphasis is precisely on individual responsibility and not one of the
platforms.”[^31]

Besides the abstract mentioning of Covid-19-related disinformation, some
officials explicitly responded to certain content, for example the
conspiracy theory that Covid-19 was caused or spread by 5G mobile
communication technology or that potential vaccinations were intended to
implant subdermal microchips.[^32] Such and similar conspiracies occur
in many of the surveyed countries,[^33] often including certain
“perpetrators” or “scapegoats” on which the pandemic is blamed. Most
common in this regard is the idea that Bill Gates was “behind” Covid-19.
[^34] Likewise prevailing is the notion that the virus was a biological
weapon developed by China or the US.[^35]

In addition to such theories of the *origin* of Covid-19, the pandemic
is used to foster existing prejudices against minorities and already
vulnerable societal groups – including Jews,[^36] Asians,[^37] and
migrants.[^38] Equally notable is the reported prejudice mentioned in
the reports from Lithuania and Serbia that Covid-19 was spread by NATO
troops stationed in the respective country.[^39]

Court decisions on the removal of Covid-19-related content were not
available to all researchers. This might also be due to the impact the
pandemic had on court proceedings.[^40] However, information concerning
criminal proceedings against users was available in multiple countries.
In that regard, contributions reflect different national approaches to
governing speech online: while there is a group of countries in which
individual users have been prosecuted for spreading “fake news” as a
misdemeanor under the respective national criminal law,[^41] reported
criminal proceedings in other countries are limited to violations of
social distancing rules offline,[^42] documentations of such violations
in content posted online[^43] or cases of online-incitement to commit
offline-violations (such as to attend prohibited protests).[^44]

Overall, it seems the pandemic has not (yet) reframed the way private
actors are conceived of as potential enforcers of public rules. On the
one hand, the enforcement of mask-wearing obligations by railway
companies was debated in three countries,[^45] and shopkeepers and
education institutions were widely obliged to ensure mask-wearing and
social distancing rules within their respective spaces.[^46] However, as
for the broader discussion on private enforcement of public rules,
participating countries are both individually and collectively far away
from a consensus whether private actors, be they railway companies,
shopkeepers or online platforms, should or should not “play
policeman”.[^47]

Across all submitting countries, online platforms have been used to
disseminate governmental or municipal restrictions and suggestions
pertaining to Covid-19,[^48] underlining the importance platforms such
as Facebook or Twitter have for communicating governmental information.

The use of these platforms seems to focus on spreading easy-to-access
overviews of rules and suggestions,[^49] likely in response to the
complexity and volatility of infection prevention rules and suggestions:
in the pandemic, platforms seem to become increasingly crucial spaces to
receive information about changes to (infection prevention) rules and,
perhaps even more importantly, to receive information that helps to make
sense of the fast-changing letter of the law. In this respect,
governmental entities have in two submitting countries formed new
alliances with social media influencers as a means to convey accessible
Covid-19-related information.[^50]

According to the submitting researchers’ individual, qualitative
assessments, the role of platforms in dealing with Covid-19-related
discourses/disinformation has not (yet) significantly impacted the way
these platforms are considered. Although some submissions point to an
increasing public awareness regarding issues such as Covid-19
disinformation,[^51] most of those assert, in one form or another, that
“it does not appear (for now) that (…) Covid-19-related disinformation
has impacted public opinion regarding the role of platforms (...)”,[^52]
assessing that any current debate’s “focus is usually on specific
instances of moderation decisions, (…) and a wider or a more systematic
reconsideration of the role of platforms is lacking.”[^53]

Assessments regarding the question whether platforms have dealt with
Covid-19-related discourses and disinformation sensibly vary: some
submissions assert that platforms have done rather well in striking the
necessary balance between respecting freedom of expression and necessary
intervention,[^54] while other researchers fear that the platforms’
removal of Covid-19-related content might be a gateway to overly
invasive content moderation practices in general.[^55]

The importance attached to the problems of private content moderation
seems to vary due to differences in perceived reliability or
trustworthiness of other, official information about the spread of
Covid-19: where official information on Covid-19 is scarce, addressing
this scarcity is considered as a more pressing step (than private
intervention) towards limiting the spread of disinformation.[^56]
Moreover, contributions underscore the need for further research into
the pandemic’s effect on private content moderation practices.[^57]
Overall, responses to the question whether platforms dealt with the
issue sensibly were positive. In most states, platforms succeeded in
providing access to authoritative information on the pandemic.[^58]
Covid-19-related moderation in some cases even led to positive spillover
effects on moderation practices regarding hate speech.[^59] The
interplay of information provided by states, traditional media outlets
and platforms is explicitly mentioned as fruitful in combating
disinformation in some cases.[^60]

Some submissions, however, point out inadequacies in the moderation of
disinformation on platforms.[^61] This relates to inadequate expertise
and insufficient staffing,[^62] lack of effort,[^63] lack of a
country-tailored approach,[^64] missing interlinkage with reliable
official sources,[^65] and unclear duties of platforms.[^66] The main
challenges identified in some countries relate to ensuring the
authenticity of information on platforms,[^67] the misuse of
disinformation on the pandemic as a tool for party politics,[^68] and a
lack of private-public cooperation in the combat of disinformation, for
example when content flagged as disinformation by officials was only
removed by platforms in 50% of the cases.[^69] The Portuguese submission
suggests, instead of removal, a real-time fact-checking system that uses
a color scheme to classify information – “green for OK, yellow for
unchecked, and red for confirmed ‘fake news’”. In addition, the
interests behind content should be made transparent, e.g., on the
funding of the respective sites.[^70] A challenge to such a system could
be, as pointed out in another submission, conflicting statements from
experts and investigative journalists and inadequacies of the official
information system.[^71]

**Recommendations**

There are some common denominators to be identified in the
recommendations on the roles of state authorities, companies/platforms,
and civil society. One of these denominators is the need for more
efforts regarding active information and transparency: states should act
more transparently themselves regarding their emergency measures and
reasons therefore and communicate accurately, timely and
responsibly.[^72] To be able to do so in a credible manner, the quality
of the underlying emergency legislation is important, as contradictory
norms result in contradictory governmental communication.[^73] Another
common denominator is a call for active cooperation of states, platforms
and civil society. One concrete recommendation in this regard is the
establishment of contact points in every country that coordinate
cooperation.[^74] Critical information on (seemingly) divisive topics,
such as purchasing agreements for vaccines in the present climate,
should be communicated particularly transparently by governments.[^75]

States should actively use platforms in their efforts, according to some
of the recommendations.[^76] One submission calls for positive
incentives provided by the state for platforms to prioritize “truth”
instead of profits.[^77] Others point towards a need for restraint from
the state when trying to legislate against the spread of disinformation
in order not to harm freedom of expression.[^78] When considering
legislative action, some contributions call for specific national
regulation of social media platforms,[^79] while the contribution from
Germany, where such regulation is already in place, underlines the need
to assess the possible adverse impacts of this legislation (NetzDG)
during the pandemic.[^80]

Researchers recommend that platforms continue their efforts in enhancing
access to reliable information[^81] as well as in removing
disinformation.[^82] A number of contributions underline the need for
platforms to more transparently communicate the extent in which
Covid-19- related disinformation is removed.[^83] Recommended new models
include the establishment of co-regulatory measures on a
country-by-country basis.[^84] This would represent a paradigm shift,
considering the fact that platforms have, so far, succeeded in ensuring
the opposite: the submissions show that the nationalization of
platforms’ responses to Covid-19-related disinformation is limited to
fairly narrow, globally rolled-out “docking sites” for national
authorities within their platforms (e.g. featured spaces for health
authorities or access to chatbot-channels).[^85]

There is a broad consensus within the submissions that platforms should
actively and transparently check content to prevent disinformation and
provide access to reliable information.[^86] To do so effectively, they
should not merely rely on algorithms, but use sufficient human
moderators and provide adequate funding.[^87] One part of the
recommendations explicitly calls for *self*-regulation of platforms in
this regard.[^88] Platforms should moderate bearing in mind their users’
right to freedom of expression and avoid the impression of
censorship.[^89] There is no clear preference for either deletion or
flagging of content conveying disinformation.[^90] Algorithmic content
classification should be further developed to be able to take context
into account.[^91]

Public/private collaborations for spreading official information are
contextualized in significantly different ways across submissions. While
the Finnish submission evaluates the national authority’s approach to
collaborate with influencers as multipliers for reliable information as
an efficient way to combat disinformation,[^92] the German submission
focuses on the dangers for misuse of platforms’ power to magnify
governmental information. It explicitly calls for limiting such
governmental use of platforms to the ongoing health crisis. It can be
concluded that this should hold true also for other, comparable
crises.[^93]

The (present and future) role of civil society is mainly portrayed as a
provider of (social) media literacy, multiplier of reliable information,
factchecker, flagger of disinformation, and watchdog keeping in check
platforms and governments.[^94]

Concluding from the above observations and recommendations, the present
health and information crisis has led to broad common understandings in
many aspects. Lawmaking, political communication, the creation of
information and the power structures behind it, and the moderation of
content ought to be more transparent – with or without a crisis.
However, the statements we analyzed in this study also highlight some of
the disputed territories of (social) media regulation in Europe. The
underlying questions about the existence of objectifiable truth (as
opposed to “fake news”), the danger of opening Pandora’s box of
governmental control over platforms as private entities used to
disseminate this unclear “truth”, and the danger of encouraging
overbroad content governance by private actors are among the most
pressing of these questions. These potential negative impacts on human
rights might also explain the preference of some commentators to remain
within the boundaries of platform self-regulation and not to overstress
state’s responsibilities. Some submissions, on the other hand, show an
openness for more government intervention and regulation – a development
that is well underway during the Covid-19-pandemic. The nature and exact
scope of the related national norm-making if implemented, together with
the harmonization efforts at the EU level, will play a key role in the
shaping of the post-pandemic information society.

Contributions by Question and Country
=====================================

Question 1: What are the five most popular platforms (by daily active users) in your country?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Albania**

Following the study conducted by Open Society Foundation for Albania
(OSFA) in 2018 on the ‘Landscape of Online Media in Albania’, data
showed that Albanians tend to turn to traditional media for reliable
information, although online media have gained more ground recently.
According to Google Trends, the 20 most searched words by Albanians in
Google in 2017 included: Facebook, YouTube, Google, newspapers,
panorama, Instagram, tema and lajmifundit, which shows a high interest
in social media and online media. It is worth noting that the OSFA study
of 2018, makes reference to one of the very few surveys on media usage
by the public conducted back in 2014, which states that: 73% of
respondents said they trusted information from TV, compared to 43% who
believed in radio and the press, and 46 % who believed in online media.
According to the same study, 89% of Albanians said they watch TV every
day, compared to 42% for the internet and 25% for the press. In
addition, when asked regarding the main source of information for
political news, 84% of the respondents cited television as the main
source of information.[^95]

The interview with Mr. Llazar Semini led to the following ranking of the
most popular online platforms: Balkanweb, shqiptarja.com, panorama,
Top-channel tv, exit.com.[^96] However, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram
and Tweeter are also commonly used platforms in Albania.

**Argentina**

Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube & Whatsapp

**Belgium**

In Belgium - due to its state structure -, relevant numbers often exist
on a regional rather than on a national level.[^97] In particular,
information concerning daily users appears to be available only at
regional level (Flanders).

-   Daily social media usage for Flanders = Facebook (64%), Instagram
    (30%), YouTube (25%), Twitter (10%), Linkedin and Pinterest
    (5%).[^98] These percentages relate to a study of a representative
    sample of Flemish 2.754 media users. Messenger apps such as Whatsapp
    are also very popular but only montly usage numbers are available,
    for Whatsapp this is 72%.

-   Daily usage for Wallonia = not found

<!-- -->

-   Monthly usage for Belgium (internet users between 16 to 64) =
    Facebook (80%), YouTube (79%), Facebook Messenger (68%), Whatsapp
    (60%), Instagram (50%).[^99]

**Bosnia and Herzegovina**

According to Amazon's Alexa, [^100] the five most popular platforms, by
daily active users in Bosnia and Herzegovina are as follows: 1.
Google.com 2. YouTube.com 3. Avaz.ba 4. Klix.ba 5. Facebook.com Out of
these the five most popular, two are local news portals that have
country-wide audience (klix.ba and avaz.ba). Avaz.ba is one of the
oldest daily newspapers (some of its content qualified as tabloid
journalism) in the country, which started as a print version – Dnevni
avaz, still published since 1995, and with an online version, enabling
free access to a part of its content, but also a subscription option for
additional content via Avaz Digital. Both avaz.ba and klix.ba have their
official accounts on all social media platforms.[^101]

**Croatia**

Facebook, WhatsApp, Viber, YouTube (based on my assessment)

### Cyprus

Facebook/ Instagram/ Twitter/ YouTube/ Linkedin\
It should be noticed that Cyprus has a population of just 1.19 million
(February 2019) and 1.01 million are internet users. The number of
social media users in Cyprus accessing sites via a mobile is 920,000
which is 77% of the population.[^102]

**Denmark**

Facebook 63%, YouTube 26%, Instagram 25%, Snapchat 24%, LinkedIn 7%

**Estonia**

Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn.[^103] – English language
and Estonian. Only Estonian language: Delfi.ee, Postimees.ee, err.ee,
epl.ee

**Finland**

In social media most popular platforms are Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
Pintarest, YouTube. Regarding digital platforms in general Facebook,
Twitter, Iltalehti, Iltasanomat and Suomi 24.

**Germany**

1\. WhatsApp, 2. Google, 3. YouTube, 4. Facebook, 5. Instagram.[^104]

**Israel**

1\. WhatsApp, 2. Google, 3. YouTube, 4. Facebook, 5. Ynet (local
site).[^105]\
Surveys show a rise in usage of social media during Covid-19.[^106]

**Italy**

According to one of the most referred statistics by Italian social media
experts, the most used social media in Italy are the following (data
related to the year 2019):\
Social Media Monthly users in Italy\
1. YouTube 36.100.000 \
2. Facebook 35.900.000 \
3. Instagram 27.000.000 \
4. LinkedIn 18.700.000 \
5. Pinterest 16.600.000 \
\
Statistics show that while Twitter is in the sixth position, with
10.200.000 users, TikTok has surged rapidly in the last months, so it is
likely that with more recent data it will be included in the top-five,
excluding another platform.[^107]\
According to another source[^108] the statistics of market share show
different users count but the same social platforms\
1. Facebook \
2. Pinterest\
3. Twitter\
4. Instagram\
5. YouTube

**Latvia**

There are no recent statistics regarding the most popular platforms in
Latvia. However, following the independent researcher's data from May,
the most popular social networks in Latvia were Facebook, Instagram,
YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest.[^109] At the same time, it must
be noted that this survey did not include the common communication
platforms, such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. Older data shows that
already in 2018 WhatsApp was used by 85 per cent of the
responders[^110]; thus, it could also be one of the TOP 5 platforms in
Latvia.

**Lithuania**

1\) Facebook, 2) Pinterest, 3) YouTube, 4) Instagram, 5) Twitter (Social
Media Stats in Lithuania - September 2020[^111]). According to a survey
conducted by “Synopticum”, in April 2020, 46% of users said that the
time they spent in social media increased during the lockdown. Yet
social media were not the main source of news regarding Covid-19. The
main source of such information were news portals (for 39 % of users)
followed by TV (30%) and social media (17%). For women, social media
were on the second place after TV. 46% of respondents did not consider
information on Covid-19 posted on social media to be reliable whereas
43% considered it reliable.[^112]

Data of one of the leading mobile network operators, “Bitė”, show that
after the end of lockdown in mid-June, the use of Facebook and YouTube
dropped below the pre-lockdown levels.[^113] However, in August and
September, according to “Bitė”, Facebook has reached the peak of its use
this year and is a clear leader in Lithuania. The use of “Instagram” has
dropped by 30% compared to the peak of the pandemic in April as a
portion of its users possibly migrated to “TikTok” which is the leader
in the increase of data flow. Popularity of conversation platforms
(“Zoom, “Messenger”, “WhatsApp”, “Viber”, etc.) has grown. The flow of
data to serve them has increased by 480%.

After the lockdown (which lasted from mid-March to mid-June) their use
diminished but still remains higher than prior to the lockdown. Data
flow to serve “Microsoft Teams” in September was 90% higher than before
the lockdown.[^114]. In 2018 a survey was conducted to compare the
statistics of social media sites where people have accounts to social
media accounts that are actually used. The biggest number of accounts
was on 1) Facebook, 2) Google+, 3) YouTube, 4) Viber, 5) Instagram but
according to the actual use the list was 1) Facebook, 2) YouTube, 3)
Instagram, 4) Google +, 5) Viber.[^115]

**Moldova**

Social Media Stats for Republic of Moldova during Sept 2019 – Sept
2020[^116]:

I\) Facebook: 84,15 %; II) Pinterest: 8,11 %; III) YouTube: 4,07 %; IV)
Instagram: 1,15 %; V) Twitter: 0,99%; VI) VKontakte: 0,96 %

**Norway**[^117]

The most popular Websites are YouTube, Facebook, VG.no, NRK.no,
Netflix.no[^118] VG.no is the online site of a national newspaper. NRK
(Norsk Rikskringkastning) is the site of the state broadcaster, whose
original medium was television. The most popular social media platforms
are Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and YouTube.[^119]

### Portugal (a)

Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Whatsapp, Linkedin.[^120]

**Serbia**

1.Facebook; 2. Instagram; 3. YouTube; 4. Twitter; 5. LinkedIn[^121]

**South Africa**

Whatsapp; YouTube; Facebook (incl. Facebook Messenger); Instagram;
Twitter[^122]

**Spain**

Based on the study *Digital situation, Internet and social networks
Spain 2020*[^123], it must be taken into account that Spain has 46.75
million inhabitants, 80% of them living in urbanized areas. There are
54.11 million mobile connections, which means 116% compared to the total
population, and the total number of Internet users is 42.40 million,
meaning that 91% of the population has access to the service. Users of
social networks represent 29 million, which means that 62% of Spaniards
use them. Five networks are the most common in Spain, by order: YouTube
with 89% (Salaverría[^124],2019; AIMC, 2019[^125]; Yi Min Shun
Xiz[^126], 2020; Epdata, 2020[^127]), Whatsapp with 86% (declared as
active users) (Salaverría, 2019 and Yi Min Shun Xiz, 2020), Facebook
with 79%, Instagram with 65%, Twitter with 53% (declared as active
users). Consideration could also be given to other smaller cases, such
as Pinterest or Linkedin (AIMC, Epdata, 2020).

\
Question 2: Were certain platforms or types of platforms (like messengers) in your country more affected by Covid-19-related disinformation than others? If yes, please name them and indicate a source
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Albania

### There are no clear-cut scientific studies in this regard. Fake news is spread via online platforms (mainly Facebook and WhatsApp), but also via traditional media. 

###  

### A local fact-checking news site regularly puts forward cases, mainly concerning the government not keeping pledges.[^128] Regarding Covid-19, the Faktoje.al, a news fact-checking portal points out to the disinformation circulating in the Albanian online media but also in various TV programs. The so-called "folk doctors" with a relatively high number of audiences/followers on social networks, especially Facebook, have been for several months pushing forward their own "campaign" offering supposedly cures for Covid-19 treatment.[^129] 

###  

### “I have cured a family … it is merely a flu, it will disappear with the arrival of the summer” – interview with a Folk Doctor^5^ on one of the most popular TV programs in Albania on May 8, 2020.[^130] On 14 July 2020, the police arrested two persons who through the social network "Facebook" called for the production of substances for the treatment of Covid-19 virus from a mixture of hydrochloric acid with water. 

###  

### In an interview with Fax News, Altin Goxhaj (Lawyer) argued that if someone dies of Covid-19 the state takes over the funeral ceremony, which on itself raises suspicions. According to the him, from unconfirmed data, it results that the state is paid around EUR 16-18 million and this has led to an increase in figures. He claims that the numbers are being manipulated because the government makes profit out of it.[^131] 

###  

### On the social network "WhatsApp" circulated a text message[^132] which stated "the Ministry of Health has approved an immediate reward of EUR 350, for those who stay at home", which was accompanied by a link. In fact, this "information" was denied by the Minister of Health and Social Protection, while the link was a "trap" that led nowhere.[^133] 

**Argentina**

Google, Facebook and Twitter

**Belgium**

Sources concerning online disinformation in Belgium mostly refer to
Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp as being the platforms affected by
Covid-19-related disinformation.[^134] None of the three seems
specifically more affected than the others.

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

The beginning of the pandemic saw increased chain-messaging via Viber
and WhatsApp platforms, with disinformation about various aspects of the
pandemic, including advice by real or imaginary doctors from foreign
countries on how the spread of the virus can be prevented.[^135] In
addition, there was a lot of targeting of persons with who were reported
as early positive cases, with false news about their irresponsible
behaviour that caused the spread of the virus. For example, a woman who
returned from Italy with her family in the end of February, when World
Health Organisation declared world pandemic, was a subject of false
reporting, when the most popular daily newspaper in BiH *Dnevni avaz*
carried the information about her going to a concert attended by 500
people and using public transport while infected.[^136] Furthermore,
social media platforms, Facebook in particular, were affected by the
spread of disinformation published on personal accounts managed by both
private and public persons with thousands of likes and shares in a
matter of minutes. The disinformation mostly pertained to various
conspiracy theories about the virus, the harmful, even lethal effects of
wearing masks, disinformation about the number of Covid-19 positive
cases, etc. Regional portals *raskrinkavanje.ba* and *istinomjer.ba*
publish regular analyses and fact-checking on content published about
the pandemic on various platforms.[^137] An overview of the published
items indicates that no platform is immune to the disinformation spread,
even though Facebook accounts and click-bait portals lead the way.[^138]

**Croatia**

WhatsApp and Viber, according to the platform Faktograf.[^139] Often the
comments under news are found in many news portal spreading fake news
and misconceptions (such as: Index.hr, 24sata.hr, Narod.hr and many
others).

### Cyprus

2\. There are no clear-cut scientific studies in this regard. However,
Facebook seems to be the platform which is mostly affected by Covid19
fake news since there is a massive spread of disinformation. We should
notice, according to the latest Eurobarometer of EU related to
“attitudes towards the impact of digitalization on our lives”,[^140]
that given the fact that Cypriots visits sites from both Greece and
Cyprus a large number of users come across fake news. Social media
platforms are among the first three reasons for this danger (special
Eurobarometer 503 related to the impact of digitalisation on daily
lives). In that meaning we should notice that an Athens prosecutor is
examining posts on social media networks and news sites claiming that
the pandemic is essentially a conspiracy, urging people to refuse to
accept fines and sanctions and to disobey restrictions to contain a
further spread.[^141] The same thing is being also examined in Cyprus. 

**Denmark**

Facebook and its messaging service has been used to spread
mis-information about Covid,[^142] but also platforms as Instagram have
been used.[^143]

**Estonia**

There have been no methodical studies into this issue. The main known
source for spreading disinformation is Facebook. Although news portals
do not in general spread false information, there are a couple of
portals that are known to portray information in a biased way or spread
disinformation. The two main portals are objektiiv.ee and
uueduudised.ee. For example, there are news items that emphasize the
“international nature” of coronavirus cases in Estonia. An article on
uueduudised.ee from 28 July states that “The Estonian corona epic was
initiated by an Iranian, continued by the Italians, and now supplemented
by Ukrainians and Poles”.[^144]

**Finland**

In Finland there is no wide and documented wave of disinformation. Only
singular cases can be found from Facebook, Twitter and different online
discussion platforms like Suomi24, Ylilauta and to a certain extent
Iltalehti and Iltasanomat

**Germany**

There are no clear-cut scientific studies in this regard. In media
reports, Telegram is often mentioned as a platform to dodge
fact-checking and Covid-19-related content moderation.[^145] The
investigation and fact-checking network Correctiv published
(non-representative) numbers indicating YouTube as primary source for
Covid-19-related misinformation (2. Websites; 3. FB; 4. Twitter; 5.
Telegram) and Whatsapp as the primary distribution channel (2. Facebook,
3. YT, 4. Website; 5. Twitter).

**Israel**

There are no scientific/empirical source indicating whether certain
platforms were more affected than others in Israel. However in an
Israeli conference regarding "fake news during covid-19 days" one of the
speakers, Orit Perlov, who specializes in social media in the middle
east, mentioned that in her opinion WhatsApp's groups are more dangerous
in this time than public platforms such as twitter. Perlov gave as an
example messages from military colleagues, and emphasized that the
spreader identity provides credibility to the message delivered. The
assumption that WhatsApp groups are more affected than other platforms
is particularly relevant to small countries as Israel.[^146]

**Italy**

Yes, some studies suggest Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter.[^147] More
generally, it has been remarked that the involvement of social media was
deep and broad in Italy. Indeed: “Italy was totally involved in this
infodemic. For instance, a report highlighted that the term
“Coronavirus” accounted for 575,000 searches by Italian users out of a
monthly total of 950,000 (Sciuto & Paoletti, 2020). In a study by
Edelman (2020), Italy was the country with the highest percentage of
people accessing news and information about the virus on a daily basis
(58%), overtaking countries like Korea, Japan and US. AGCOM (2020) found
that, as a proportion of disinformation published online, Coronavirus
contents rose from 5% in early January to 46% in late March. On social
media, in particular, Coronavirus posts increased to 36% of all messages
produced by disinformation sources” (Lovari, 2020). 

**Latvia**

Facebook has become a platform where the spread of disinformation,
including Covid-19 connected fake news and especially videos explaining
the dangers of vaccines and masks or the posts regarding the "fakeness"
of Covid‑19 tests, has been the easiest. Even though there are no
researches on that yet, it can be seen when looking at the rebuked news
and their sources[^148]. Additionally, 2020 was a "good time" for the
fake-news connected Facebook pages and also independent internet pages
posting dubious news, which later got shared on Facebook.[^149] Such
information was also used by politicians to gain popularity.

Similarly, also WhatsApp became a source of fake news regarding full
quarantine to be imposed in Latvia.[^150] However, these have been more
or less independent cases. In addition to that, a group of people
fighting against vaccines, 5G and Bill Gates, after being "censored" by
Facebook have also created their own channel in Telegram.[^151]
Nonetheless, this social network yet has to gain its popularity.

It is essential to note that several fake news have also been
distributed in Russian or have been translated from this language. At
the beginning of spring 2020 such news mainly denied the dangers of the
virus.[^152] Later the Russian-speaking media distributed news regarding
the NATO Extended Presence Battlegroup stationed in Latvia, whose
soldiers *en masse* supposedly had gotten ill with Covid-19.[^153]

### Lithuania

When it comes to social media, disinformation was mainly published on
Facebook and YouTube. Besides that, it appeared on certain controversial
news portals (Debunk EU: Latvia had the widest spread of Covid-19
related disinformation in May, 11-06-2020,[^154] see specifically this
link.[^155]

Facebook groups were created, YouTube channels were advertised in such
groups. Fake profiles were created on Facebook. Comments sections on
mainstream news portals were used to districute disinformation.
(Ekspertas apie Covid-19 ir dezinformaciją: pandemija atgaivino visas
senąsias sąmokslo teorijas, 2020-09-26.[^156] Comments on Facebook
accounts of the Government and of the Ministry of Health are made from
fake Facebook accounts (SAM įspėja: auga dezinformacijos kiekis,
nukreiptas prieš kaukių dėvėjimą, 2020-09-17.[^157]

According to Mažvydas Kunevičius, Chief Lieutenant of the Lithuanian
Armed Forces, the Strategic Communication Department, since the
beginning of the quarantine, such networks as YouTube, Facebook,
VKontakte, Reddit, Twitter as well as controversial news portals and
online blogs were used to spread misleading information and conspiracy
theories. There were cases when e-mails were generated and sent to
high-ranking officials, institutions and the media to perform
information attacks (Experts warn: false information on Covid-19 on
social media spreads fast, 12-05-2020).[^158]

**Moldova**

There are no exact data in this regard. According to the survey
conducted in May 2020 by WatchDog.md and CBS Axa,[^159] the Degree of
fake news according to reliable information sources had been the
following:

Television: 7,48 points

Informative sites on internet: 7,26

Social networks on internet: 8,13

Social networks: Facebook: 7,8 points; Odnoklassniki: 8,3; Vkontakte:
8,0; Instagram: 7,6; Telegram: 7,3

**Norway**

There is no specific research on this, but some sources point towards
disinformation on certain platforms. The website Faktisk.no fact checks
information spread on social media and news stories. Their recent
findings of disinformation relate mainly to Facebook posts,[^160] but
also document.no,[^161] and one case about NRK.no.[^162] Many of the
Facebook posts they fact-check had gained attention as they were posted
or shared by ‘famous’ Norwegians.

### Portugal

Facebook and Whatsapp.[^163]

**Serbia**

Scientific studies about spreading Covid-19 disinformation are still
missing in Serbia, but *FakeNews tragač*, an online platform established
within media and NGOs’ *Debunking Disinformation* project to fight
disinformation spread in the Serbian media and platforms, published the
study on “Korona virus Infodemija u Srbiji” in April 2020.[^164]The
study includes research on the Covid-19 disinformation on popular
platforms. From March 12 to April 12, 2020, the research team detected
43 disinformation about Covid-19, broadcasted 241 times by different
traditional media and online platforms in Serbia. In the same period,
241 disinformation only on Facebook was shared 223.446 times.[^165] In
the daily media, Facebook is also often mentioned as a platform from
which various unverified information related to Covid-19 comes.[^166]

It should be added that, in the 2018 Europe Communication Monitor
Report, that targeted 48 countries, Serbia, together with the Check
Republic, Russia and Romania, was identified as the country with the
strongest impact of fake news.^5^ The social media were detected as the
most common source of disinformation. To fight against Covid-19
disinformation, the journalists in Serbia has established a specialized
internet portal “raskrinkavanje.rs”.^6^

**South Africa**

Yes, Whatsapp, followed by Facebook and then Twitter.[^167]

**Spain**

The most affected platforms by Covid19-related disinformation are
Whatsapp[^168] \[by “rumors, hoaxes, and interested inventions”\],
Facebook, Instagram[^169] and Twitter, which “is a web of real people
intertwined with a vast population of bots and fake accounts behind
which we do not know who is hiding”[^170]. More

over, the first three ones would be “responsible for more than
two-thirds (69%) of all fake news”[^171].

The European Communication Monitor (2018)[^172] underlined that Spain
was one of the countries with the most vivid debates about fake news
(64,9%). Its public opinion was influenced by 61% (p. 20). The report
also informs that Social Media is the largest source of false news
(81.3%), after Media (59.6%) and internal media (14.3%) (p. 27).
Communication professionals already foresee that until 2021
disinformation will be one of the issues with which they will have to
deal (12,3%) (p. 46). Salaverría *et al.* (2019) understand
disinformation when deliberately false data is spread for economic,
ideological or other reasons[^173]. This study distinguishes the
following types of hoaxes by gradation: joke, exaggeration,
decontextualization, deception. The indisputably most frequent modality
is deception (64.4%) (p. 10). As for the format, the most frequent is
the text (p. 6).

Question 3: What have the five most popular platforms done to combat Covid-19-related disinformation in your country, including in relation to protests? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: We are especially interested in is specific measures taken by
platforms within your countr[]{#_fu8plrpfoguo .anchor}y[]{#_dr0hrkhyyzy1
.anchor}

### Albania

No specific measures taken. Faktoje.al (mentioned above) has often
pointed out to the spread of fake news. It should be said, though, that
Albanian media portals are not that attentive or checking on the news.
The government is re-considering a new law on digital platforms, portals
and the spread of fake news by them. After OSCE and EU complained of the
previous version of the Law passed by the parliament, they are now
reconsidering. The new Law is expected to introduce heavy fines on
portals with fake news.

**Argentina:**

a\) Facebook introduced a new feature on its platform that automatically
detects when a user is about to post a link about the coronavirus and
sends a notification with context about the article beforehand to
prevent misinformation. Also created a hub.[^174] More information
here[^175] and here[^176]. b) Google is working with media in the region
to help them distribute their content within Google products and
launched an experience for Covid-19 within Google News (App, IOS and
Web), which consists of highlighting the latest news about Covid-19 from
trusted sources and news about its impact around the world. c) Twitter
has started putting warning messages on tweets containing misleading
information about Covid-19. Twitter is targeting claims confirmed to be
false or misleading by experts such as public health authorities in
which the accuracy, truthfulness or credibility is contested or unknown
It said the new system would also apply to tweets sent before this week.
Teams are using and improving on internal systems to proactively monitor
content related to Covid-19. d) Alphabet Inc’s YouTube is working to
remove videos from its site that spread misinformation about Covid-19
vaccines. This will include claims that the vaccine will kill people or
cause infertility, or that microchips will be implanted in people who
receive it. YouTube already removes videos that dispute the transmission
of Covid-19 and promote medically unsubstantiated methods of treatment.
Whatsapp reduced the spread of misinformation since the start of the
Covid-19 crisis. Users are now restricted to share content that has
already been forwarded numerous times just one chat at a time and as
WhatsApp cannot directly monitor content or stop misinformation from
being spread altogether, the app has enabled the WHO and national health
authorities to share relevant facts about the pandemic to the population
at large through automated accounts.

**\
**

**Belgium**

**Facebook** says it informs its users when fact checkers find videos
which include Covid-19-related disinformation, showing people the
correct information instead.[^177] The platform moreover removes
misleading messages or conspiracy theories that confuse people and may
be harmful if believed, thereby focusing on claims that are intended to
discourage treatment or to take appropriate precautionary
measures.[^178] Most likely, Facebook’s policy in this respect does not
apply solely in Belgium. Accordingly, it should be noted that Facebook
also promotes the information site set up by the Belgian Federal Public
Health Service on the coronavirus,
[www.info-coronavirus.be](http://www.info-coronavirus.be), in the search
results on people’s timeline when they search for information about the
virus.[^179] The Facebook pages of the relevant authorities have also
been recognised as an official source of information by the
platform.[^180]

**Instagram** also promotes the information by the Belgian Federal
Public Health Service on the coronavirus,
[www.info-coronavirus.be](http://www.info-coronavirus.be), when
individuals use search key words related to the virus. The same is true
for **YouTube. **

**Twitter**, in turn, contacted the public health authorities all around
the world, including the Belgian ones, itself since the company is
concerned about the large amount of Covid-19-related disinformation that
is appearing on its platform.[^181] To prevent the spread thereof, it
now promotes the messages of the Federal Public Health Service about the
coronavirus.[^182] In particular, the information distributed by the
authorities about the coronavirus has become more important in the
algorithm used by Twitter.[^183] In this way, it is given a more
prominent place on the platform.[^184] Moreover, if you enter the term
"coronavirus" in the Twitter search engine in Belgium, you will also see
a message referring you to
[www.info-coronavirus.be](http://www.info-coronavirus.be), the
information site set up by the Federal Public Health Service on the
coronavirus, at the top of the search result under the heading ‘Know the
facts’.[^185]

No specific information was found about the other platforms.

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

The most noticeable initiative was a joint Viber Channel „Covid-19
Provjereno“ (eng. Covid-19 Confirmed or Checked) started on 4 April by
several platforms and portals in the region, namely Raskrinkavanje.ba,
Faktograf.hr, Razkrinkavanje.si, Fakenews.rs, Raskrinkavanje.me,
Raskrikavanje.rs and F2N2.mk (BiH, Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Monte
Negro and North Macedonia), that monitors, checks and detects
disinformation and false information and disseminates only fact-checked
news about the Covid -19 pandemic. The Community has just over 6,000
members,[^186] which is not a large number, when compared to the numbers
of daily users of platforms in BiH and other countries of the region.
Its value could lie in the fact that journalists and other media are
members, and who, by using the community with fact-checked content,
contribute to fighting the spread of disinformation on their respective
platforms.

According to media reports, Facebook has banned the work of the BiH
version of the Qanon group[^187], identified as a far-right conspiracy
theory that disseminates false information also with regard to
Covi-19pandemic. Previously, some of the content published in this
private FB group have been flagged as false.[^188]

**Croatia**

Platforms like Facebook or Twitter acted in the same way as in the rest
of the world removing some contents. The Croatian Agency for Electronic
Media issued a warning to the public media in March 2020 about the need
to report truly and responsibly about Covid19[^189]According to the
statement by its head in October 2020 the public media have been very
successful in following this warning.[^190] Platforms were not covered
by this opinion.

### Cyprus

3\. There is no source on this subject. However, it is worth to mention
that an online collaborative platform has been put into operation in
order to help journalists and other organizations verify social
networking in an attempt to counter the spread of false news. This
platform called “Truly Media” was developed by the Athens Technology
Center (ATC), in cooperation with Deutsche Welle, to support journalists
in verifying the content of posts. The platform used the German news
agency DPA and Bayerischer Rundfunk during the recent German elections
last September to collect and verify subscriptions of social network
users. Mr. Larkos Larkou, the Chairman of the Cyprus News Agency (CNA)
has recently addressed a special speech on this issue on the occasion of
presentation of the platform.[^191]

**Denmark**

All platforms have removed content that spread mis-information about
Covid19,[^192] removed the opportunity to monetize YouTube videos with
corona-related content, and removed users who spread mis-information
(e.g. Instagram[^193]). 

Country-wise, we see the creation of novel centers for verification of
information that certify or debunk false articles, such as
<https://www.tjekdet.dk/>. We believe that these efforts are not
specific to Denmark, but globally adopted policies adopted by each
platform.

**Estonia**

There is no specific action by the international portals. Estonian
language portals such as delfi.ee and postimees.ee are publishing daily
detailed updates of the Covid-19 information, including statistics
showing dynamics. This is done in order to provide to the population
accurate information. There is a portal which has measure so-called
“fact-control” where it is analysing a statement by a well-known public
figure and reached a conclusion about the accuracy of such statement.
For example. Delfi.ee featured on 07 November a fact-control to the
issue whether wearing a mask affects negatively one’s breathing. The
conclusion was that it does not. These fact controls are related to
issues which matter most to the society at large.

**Finland**

 THL (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare) has been actively
disseminating fact-based information, Faktabaari has been the main
non-profit organisations that has done fact checking, in general YLE
(Finnish Public Broadcasting Company) has done strong co-operation with
health authorities. But same is true with other main media platforms
(MTV uutiset, Helsingin Saomat).

**Germany**

Whatsapp: Chatbot to debunk Corona myths;[^194] German version by the
German Red Cross.[^195]International measures have also been implemented
in Germany: Fact-checking and content moderation on FB and Instagram;
limited forwarding on Whatsapp; privileging of trustworthy sources,
information boxes under videos, no fact-checking in Germany yet on
YT.[^196]

**Israel**

Platforms helped promote verified information from official sources. For
example, WhatsApp helped the ministry of health to launch a WhatsApp's
line that uses both chatbot and human response for more complexed
questions. Facebook offered assistance in financing ministry of health's
posts on it's media, in order to support distribution of verified
information. In order to fight disinformation regarding Covid-19,
Globes, one of Israel's main news sites (not top 5 platforms but a
leading news site) has decided to partially open it's paywall by making
daily articles regarding covid-19 accessible to anyone (a policy similar
to other outlets in the world such as the WSJ)\
Tiktok (not a top 5 platform)– cooperation between the presidency of
businesses and employers in Israel, Professor Roni Gamzu (Israel's
Coronavirus project coordinator) and Tiktok Israel created a music video
featuring many teen stars in order to raise the awareness among children
and youth regarding keeping social distance and wearing masks.  

**Italy**

From the side of platforms, measures taken are not different from the
usual ones (outsourcing to fact-checking platform and/or internal
assessment of accuracy). Facta - the service of factì-checking via
whatsapp - was active in Italy since 2 april 2020.[^197]

In Italy much attention was dedicated to Avaaz project, which is private
organization aiming at stopping the diffusion of disinformation and at
implementing accuracy; Avaaz works in many countries, but it has
received attention in Italy in national accredited newspapers (such as
La Repubblica or La Stampa) as a reliable source to detect
disinformation).[^198]

**Latvia**

Exactly at the beginning of pandemic (March 2020) Facebook started to
cooperate with independent fact-checkers Re:Baltica[^199] and
Delfi[^200] (both being the Latvian media), who now have the rights to
mark specific Facebook posts as containing false messages. These media
also publish the reasoning on these decisions on their webpages with
lengthy, fact-based explanations, thus reaching also other people
outside Facebook.[^201] International measures such as limited
forwarding on WhatsApp have also been implemented in Latvia.

**\
Lithuania**

At least one Facebook group was blocked (Ekspertas apie Covid-19 ir
dezinformaciją: pandemija atgaivino visas senąsias sąmokslo teorijas,
2020-09-26,[^202] ; the group in question had 50,000 followers,
01/07/2020)[^203].

**Moldova**

There are five primary roles that social platforms are playing during
the pandemic outbreak in R. Moldova[^204]: to combat disinformation on
coronavirus; to influence the public response to the outbreak; to
provide support and assistance for vulnerable social categories affected
by the pandemic through the creation of the special groups[^205];[^206]
(for example: “Coronavirus Moldova: mutual help,” “We support local
business in Moldova”); to keep decision-makers accountable.

In order to spread awareness about the Russian campaign against Western
countries, Moldova’s social media has provided regularly updated
information about Russia’s disinformation. Analyses conducted by local
media outlets emphasized that fake news labs in the Russian Federation
have used various untruthful information about the COVID-19 pandemic,
which is circulated on social media, to launch a wide-scale
disinformation campaign directed against the US and the EU, that have
influenced the Republic of Moldova.[^207]

Facebook places info from authorized institutions such as Moldovan
Emergency Assistance 112, to fight disinformation.[^208]

**Norway**

Facebook entered a third-party fact checking agreement with Faktisk.no
in 2018,[^209] which has covered a lot of disinformation about Covid-19
this year.[^210] NRK is referring to the Norwegian Institute of Public
Health for correct information.[^211] Medietilsynet (the Norwegian Media
Authority) ran a fact checking campaign to prevent the spread of false
information about Covid-19.[^212]

In the beginning of the pandemic, most large news outlet websites
(Aftenposten.no, NRK.no, VG.no, etc.) had a “Covid-19” banner on top of
the page for the latest information about Covid. These information sites
would point to FHI (Folkehelseinstituttet; the National Institute of
Public Health) and helsenorge.no (the official health platform for
inhabitants of Norway)[^213] for up-to-date information. Now, these top
banners with direct links to official Covid-19 information are no longer
there, and there are few links to FHI and helsenorge.no in general.

### 

### Portugal (a)

The International Fact Checking Network created a system available 24
hours a day that allows WhatsApp users to detect fake news about
Covid-19. In Portugal, the online journal "Observador" is part of the
project. However, it is not available in Portuguese.[^214]

### Portugal (b)

A strong presence of ethics committees and data protection groups.
Legislation on data protection and on the security of citizens' identity
on digital networks has been strengthened.

**Serbia**

What could be noticed is that certain social networks such as Facebook
and Instagram have introduced fact-checking and content moderation, but
in this context, no platform in Serbia cooperates with them.[^215]

**South Africa**

Regulations issued in terms of the Disaster Management Act 57 of 2002
render it an offence to disseminate information about Covid, any
person's Covid status or any government measures against Covid.[^216]
Directives issued under the regulations obligate certain Electronic
Services Licensees, OTTs and ISPs to remove fake news related to
Covid-19 from their platforms immediately after it is identified as
such.[^217] It is difficult to monitor compliance with these provisions,
but local social media offices do not appear to be monitoring the
platforms for misinformation or removing such information. Instead,
online newspapers and non-governmental organisations run fact checks,
and misinformation is removed in response to public outrage or the
possibility of criminal prosecution rather than any measures imposed by
the social media platforms themselves. There has been a call for the
group administrators of WhatsApp groups to monitor the content of their
groups. The main non-governmental organisations monitoring and
correcting misinformation are the Centre for Analytics and Behavioural
Change (CABC), Real 411, AFP, and AfricaCheck.[^218]

**Spain**

To combat disinformation, globally social networks, spread the news in
an alternative way with truthful information. Sometimes in a localized
way in Spain. In addition, social networks (i.e., Facebook, Google,
Twitter, YouTube) follow the EU Code of Good Conduct.[^219] In general,
social networks and the media provide truthful information, which is
contrasted by the verification platforms, as a supplementary service to
combat misinformation. Regarding YouTube and Twitter, apparently they
filter contents thanks to specialized personnel[^220]. WhatsApp does not
directly verify, nor does it control encrypted messages, but rather
facilitates the contact of verification platforms to users when they
have doubts. According to the company itself, it has four verification
platforms in Spain (Maldita, Newtral, AFP Factual and EFE
Verifica)[^221]. Facebook seems to have Newtral, Maldita.es and AFP as
contracted companies[^222]. Instagram at least uses Efe Verifica[^223].

Three types of verification platforms exist. Firstly, Spanish Fact
Checking platforms[^224] that have been already accredited by IFCN
(International Fact-Checking Network[^225]): Maldita (2014), Newtral
(2018) and Efe Verifica (2019). Secondly, other foreign platforms that
work in Spanish, such as AFP Factual[^226] that holds IFCN
accreditation[^227] too. Thirdly, attention may be paid to two other
Spanish platforms without IFCN accreditation: RTVE Verifica and the
Catalan Verificat. In turn, these verification platforms made a report
for the European Union.

Regarding the initiatives that are detected in Spain, Twitter seems to
have increased its verification efforts, has offered granting aid and
financed projects related to verification, and has promoted verified
content and official accounts that report on the coronavirus. It is also
detected that Facebook and Instagram have increased the team of
collaborators to carry out verification tasks[^228].

Question 4: In particular, can you find any statements by a) poli­ticians or b) platform representatives (like Public Policy Directors) on the issues of Covid-19-related disinformation on platforms in your country (and in your country’s language)? If yes, please cite the main points and give a source.

**Albania:**

The prime Minister of Albania said during the pandemic period as below:
*“My page on Facebook served only to accelerate and expand the space of
dissemination of information on the decisions taken step by step which
by the very nature of this war as in the whole world have been numerous
and have often changed day by day*.”[^229]

**Argentina:**

The National Ministry of Health and PAHO launched the Covid-19
supplement of the Argentine Public Health Magazine.[^230] Report of the
Internet Observatory on the construction and dissemination of fake news
that became public in digital media and social networks.[^231] All the
misinformation about Covid19.[^232]

**Belgium**

Answering a number of (written) parliamentary questions, posed by
senator Stephanie D’hose (Open VLD), concerning whether the efforts by
the Belgian security services to trace Covid-19-related disinformation
indeed pay off[^233], former Minister of the Interior, Pieter De Crem
(CD&V) replied:

“*As far as the federal police is concerned, the i2-IRU section of DJSOC
is competent to combat "fake news" as part of its mission to detect
illegal online content related to terrorism, radicalism, propaganda,
violent extremism and hate speech.*

*The section has been commissioned to focus on the detection of "fake
news" related to the coronavirus published on the Internet.*

*The "fake news" related to the coronavirus has been detected by
DJSOC/i2-IRU since the appearance of the disease. This content is
automatically reported to the platforms by requesting a removal
request.*

*Requests for active collaboration were sent by the section to the major
social networking platforms present on the Internet.*

*It should be noted that "fake news" is not legally defined and
therefore it is not possible to prosecute the publishers without
malicious intent.*

*On 30 March 2020, DJSOC/i2-IRU has already discovered and reported 231
facts related to "fake news" and 16 sites publishing this type of
content.*

*As far as the sites are concerned, in the absence of a legal basis, it
is difficult to legally oblige the Belgian access providers or the DNS
to carry out the removal or redirection to the "STOP" page of the
government.*

*"Fake news" appears regularly on all social networks and internet
sites.*

*Usually it concerns content that spreads false rumors of a medical
nature, about the origin of the virus, or about the remedies to be taken
to prevent the disease.*

*Sometimes this content stigmatizes a minority as being responsible for
the spread of the virus.*

*The i2-IRU section has no coercive powers over social networking
platforms and can only request removal. The platforms are not obliged to
respond to these requests*”.[^234]

Former Minister of Telecommunications, Philippe De Backer (Open VLD),
stated that:

“*As far as possible steps are concerned, the online platforms obviously
play a major role. All major Internet platforms have made efforts to
increase the visibility of the World Health Organization (WHO), and, in
Belgium, of the government website www.info-coronavirus.be, on their
services. They have also all adapted their content policies in response
to Covid-19. Facebook, for example, announced that it would now remove
claims intended to discourage treatment or the taking of appropriate
precautions. However, there are several important challenges with regard
to the new content restrictions, especially in terms of transparency of
reasoning and enforcement of the rules. In addition, the major platforms
continue to generate revenue with disinformation and harmful content
about the pandemic, for example by hosting online ads on pages that
misrepresent migrants as the cause of the virus, promote false
treatments or spread conspiracy theories about the virus*”.[^235]

The former Minister of Telecommunications, Philippe De Backer (Open
VLD), furthermore stated that *“\[t\]he big online platforms continue to
generate revenue with disinformation and malicious content about the
pandemic, for example by hosting online advertisements on pages that
misrepresent migrants as the cause of the virus*”.[^236]

However, in Belgium, no specific statements seem to have been made by
platform representatives (like Public Policy Directors) on the issues of
Covid-19-related disinformation on platforms.

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

The early period of the Covi-19virus spread in BiH, followed by the
government „lockdown“ measures (mid-March 2020), has seen the
unprecedented information overload (infodemic), some of which can
presumably be qualified as disinformation. In those early days,
government officials invested their efforts in urging the public to
consume the information in a responsible manner and warned about the
hazards of trusting unverified sources and news. Some examples:

Šefik Džeferović, Chairman of the BiH Presidency called the citizens to
use exclusively information coming from official institutions and
published by credible media. He also demanded that all media in BiH
report in a truthful, objective and responsible manner, in order to
prevent sensationalism and the spread of fake news which could lead to
panic.[^237]

Communication Regulation Agency (CRA) of BiH issued an official
statement urging media to publish information without sensationalism and
spread of disinformation which might result in the spread of fear, panic
and disturbance of public.[^238]

On 4 April, the Press Council in BiH, a self-regulatory body for print
and online media, issued a public appeal to citizens to report fake news
and potential violations of the Council's Code for print and online
media. It also reminded of the importance of accountable, accurate and
timely reporting on the novel corona virus.[^239]

In addition, and apart from the mere statements, the entity of Republika
Srpska (one of the two entities in BiH) issued a decree prohibiting the
transmission of information that may cause panic or severely violate
public peace and order and introducing punitive measures, including
fines, for spreading “fake news” about the virus in the media and on
social networks. The order was in force from 19 March to 17 April 2020
and was annulled as a result of immense pressure coming from various
international organisations, the media community and CSOs.[^240]

**\
Croatia**

Faktograf[^241] makes checks on different statements and fake-news
claims and looks for the truth behind them. 

### Cyprus

4\. a) The department of cybercrime police of the Republic of Cyprus has
recently announced special advices on its official site warning citizens
about fake news around Covid-19. 

“The spread of disinformation and misinformation around \#Covid19 has
potentially harmful consequences for public health and effective crisis
communication. Stay vigilant and only trust information from official
accounts!”.[^242]

b\) “President Nicos Anastasiades stepped in on Wednesday in attempt to
effectively put an end to the “fake news” stirring up “unfounded”
concerns among the public over the coronavirus crisis being taken
advantage of for the quiet installation of 5G network infrastructure.
Condemning the creation and dissemination of 5G-related fake news,
Anastasiades said that no company has been granted license to install 5G
networks on the island”.[^243]

c\) “the news that a pharmacist and a market worker tested positive for
Covid19 are fake”, Representative of the Minister of Health, Margarita
Kyriakou.[^244]

**Denmark**

- Facebook policy director, states that it is not the task to check if
politicians are telling the truth or not.[^245]\
- Lisbeth Knudsen, is the interim editor-in-chief of Mandag Morgen /
Altinget, chairman of the Democracy Commission, the VL groups and the
Danish School of Media and Journalism. 

**Estonia**

There are no such statements by platform representatives addressing
directly the matter of misinformation. Some politicians have commented
in FB government policies, for example the Minister of Social Affairs
Mr. Tanel Kiik. Other politicians from the opposition are often using FB
to express their views on the matter of Covid-19. These postings once in
a while call for the need to provide to the public accurate information,
but we have not detected that the postings address specifically
misinformation matters.

**\
Finland**

Findings from Faktabaari factchecking on Covi-19disinformation can be
found here.[^246] This is also provided in international website of
poynter.org.[^247]

**Germany**

a\) Federal Minister of Health, Jens Spahn: “Especially in social media,
there are many people with their own interests at stake who want to
unsettle citizens.” He had the impression that they from outside or
inside “want to disintegrate us in our debate, in our society.”[^248]

b\) Federal Minister of Justice, Christine Lambrecht: “I expect social
networks to live up to their responsibility: They must clearly
prioritize trustworthy and relevant information, quickly identify and
delete fake news and block accounts that spread it.”[^249]

c\) Minister of the Interior of the State of Lower Saxony, Boris
Pistorius, with regards to social media and messenger services: “It must
be prohibited to publicly disseminate untrue allegations about the
supply situation of the population, medical care or cause, routes of
infection, diagnosis and therapy of Covid-19.”[^250]

d\) Minister of Justice of the State of Saxony-Anhalt, Anne-Marie Keding:
“I think it is wrong to introduce an additional criminal offence for
fake news now. \[...\] That would be practically impossible to
implement. \[...\] These social networks should finally live up to their
responsibility. \[e.g. no anonymity.\] I consider the mixture of fake
news and social bots a great danger.”[^251]

**Israel**

a\) Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel – I call the public to
beware of disinformation regarding Covid-19 in Israel. Follow only
formal announcements by the ministry of health and officials.[^252] I
would like to disprove an urban legend that is clearly fake news,
whereby I attend to implant subdermal microchips, this kind of
conspiracies is surreal.[^253]

b\) Motti Cohen, Acting Chief of Police – The police will act firmly
towards those who will choose to spread disinformation, that could
generate panic among the public. The police call the public to restraint
and act responsibly. There is a strict ban on distribution of "fake
news". Formal announcements are only distributed by officials and in the
Ministry of Health's website.[^254]\
\
c) Ministry of Communication – Over the last few hours, many "fake news"
messages about the Coronavirus are being distributed. The last ones are
false messages regarding Givatayim.   The Ministry of Health stresses
that official and verified announcements can only be found at the
Ministry of Health's website, at the Ministry of Health Coronavirus
Updates telegram, and in the official CoronApp application.   Help us
distribute official and verified information only from official
sources.[^255]

In recent months there has been an obvious trend within social media,
involving disinformation regarding the 5G technology and covid-19. For
the avoidance of doubt, there is no relation between the 5G technology
to covid-19, the rumor about this alleged relation is fake news.[^256]

**Italy**

Yes, the Government instituted an anti-fake news task force
acknowledging that "disinformation weakens the effort to limit the
spreading of the pandemic disease".[^257]

The Government also stated that the task force aims at enhancing and
protecting citizens' rights to be informed, by promoting the
identification of institutional and/or reliable sources, as well as by
giving methodological insights to enhance awareness and 'ability to
discern' in the selection and sharing of news in the internet.[^258] 

**Latvia**

a\) Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Culture and State Police have
published a plea for the people to critically appraise the sources from
which information on Covid-19 is obtained, and to obtain the information
from official sources. The appeal contains the guidelines prepared by
the Ministry of Culture regarding the evaluation of information to
recognise fake news.[^259]

b\) The main infectologist of Latvia has stated that homoeopathic
remedies are not medicines and there is false information about their
positive effects in combating the disease caused by the Covid-19. This
opinion refers to a popular Facebook post[^260]. This post was also
exposed by other users, including doctors, among other things, on
Twitter. It was stated that this post was going to be discussed at the
meeting of the board of the Latvian Medical Association and also at the
Certification Council of the Medical Association. Several board members
believe that calls to treat Covid-19 with homoeopathy are irresponsible,
as there is currently no specific cure for the disease.[^261]

c\) Minister of Health has criticised those people who in the current
circumstances spread false news or promote conspiracy theories. "To
those who are spreading the word that Covid-19 is a fabrication and a
government conspiracy, I want to say that if we believed such
statements, we would still believe that the earth is flat because it
cannot be seen with the naked eye," noted the minister.[^262] It can be
seen that the main emphasis is precisely on individual responsibility
and not one of the platforms.

d\) Latvia has been the initiator for an interregional announcement of
the UN regarding the fight against misinformation in connection of
Covid-19 (infodemics).[^263]

e\) In his address at the 75th United Nations Latvian President Egils
Levits highlighted the scourge of disinformation. Levits said that
Latvia is concerned that among other negative consequences, Covid-19 has
created a breeding ground for misinformation, disinformation, fake news
and hate speech. States must counter misinformation and provide access
to free, reliable and science-based information through free media.
Additionally, he noted that: ''Technology companies and social media
platforms need to be more accountable for addressing online
disinformation. Social media is not merely a platform where people and
diverse information meets. The technology, the algorithms, the business
models that drive the advertising market and attention economy all play
a large part in the distribution of disinformation. Our priority must be
to protect both privacy and freedom of expression in the digital
domain.The exponential increase of misinformation, disinformation, fake
news and hate speech in recent years is dangerous not only in the
context of the pandemic. It is a general threat to world peace; it is a
general threat to efforts to solve global issues such as climate change
and environmental pollution. In short – it is a general problem of
humankind to find rational solutions to the challenges of our time.
These threats should be taken seriously both on the national and
international level''.[^264]

f\) The leader of the NATO Strategic Communications Centre Jānis Sārts in
October stated that currently, Latvia has an equal level of
disinformation to other European countries (in comparison to spring when
it was lower). Nevertheless, in his opinion, this mostly is not
organised disinformation, rather more emotion-driven circulation of
false information.[^265]

g\) Prime minister of Latvia Krišjānis Kariņš declared that the
incitement not to wear face masks is a threat to national security.
These incitements were mentioned exactly in connection to the spread of
posts in the social networks informing people that they have no legal
duty to wear the face masks and that they are even more dangerous than
the virus. "There have been such people in all countries at all times,
but with the help of the internet their message is much more accessible
than it was 20 years ago, and that has created serious concerns," the
prime minister said, adding that the majority of the public, however,
does not listen to these people.[^266]

h\) To our knowledge, there have been no statements by platform
representatives regarding Covid-19 connected disinformation in Latvia.
However, in spring 2020 Jacob Turowski, Facebook's Head of Public Policy
in the Baltics and Poland claimed: "We are pleased to launch our
third-party fact-finding program in Latvia and Estonia and to expand it
in Lithuania to include Re:Baltica and DELFI. We take a very responsible
approach to the responsibility to fight false news, so we are
continually looking for new ways to stop the spread of misinformation on
our platform. "

### Lithuania

The recommendations of the Strategic Communication Department of the
Lithuanian Armed Forces were published on the dedicated website
www.koronoastop.lt[^267] and a reference to them weas provided on
Facebook by the Government,[^268] where the main recommendations were
highlighted: to critically assess conspiracy theories on social media,
to look for information on official websites of state institutions, to
check controversial information in at least three sources. 

Recommendations to check the news by consulting official website of
state institutions, not to opt for social media as a primary source of
information, to carefully select channels of information and to check
controversial information in at least three sources were also published
on the website of the Ministry of Health[^269] where it was also advised
how to identify a false account on social networks (a number of pages
followed, mocking, insulting and provocative tone, language errors,
links to game applications).

Representation of the European Commission in Lithuania on its
website[^270] and on its Facebook account[^271] warned about the
spreading, including via social networks, of disinformation about
Covid-19 and directed towards official information as well as itself
provided certain information about Covid-19. 

It was repeated that the Commission urges Internet platforms to publish
only reliable information,[^272] to move down factually incorrect
content and delete illegal content or content that could cause physical
harm.

In an interview to Lithuanian Television, the head of the Representation
of the European Commission in Lithuania also mentioned the importance of
the Good Practice Code signed between the Commission and the Internet
platforms, emphasized the role of those platforms and also favourably
assessed the Lithuanian fact checking initiative “debunk.eu”.[^273]

 \
The Office of the Inspector of Journalist Ethics published a statement
on how to identify CIVD-19 related information and where to look for
reliable information.[^274]

Communications Regulatory Authority of the Republic of Lithuania (RRT)
published an explanation about 5G reacting to disinformation about
possible causes of Covid-19.[^275]

**Moldova**

Until the presidential elections, for the government and the competent
authorities of the Republic of Moldova, combating propaganda and fake
news had not been a priority, especially since the politicians
themselves used the media and confusing messages to manipulate voters
and to impose their own agenda. While the authorities in Chisinau
partially countered conspiracy theories, they did not respond at all to
the anti-EU and anti-Western narratives promoted by Russian propaganda.
The media and the civil society have been more active than high-level
officials in communicating and combating propaganda during the COVID-19
pandemic.[^276]

Thus, during the pandemic, most actions of media and civil society to
combat fake news focused on uncovering myths and false information,
publishing and disseminating materials containing accurate information,
presenting the struggle of health workers in the front line - one of the
sensitive topics of the pandemic – in order to urge the population to
comply with the prevention measures. One of the most well-known
initiatives for combating fake news is the platform of the Independent
Press Association - Stopfals.md, which reacted promptly to the challenge
and created a special section dedicated to fake news about COVID-19. In
addition, many NGOs, websites and TV stations have tried to dismantle
conspiracy theories and fake news.[^277]

**Norway**

There do not appear to be any specific statements by platform
representatives in Norway. There are, however, some politicians who have
issued statements, as well as representatives of health institutions. In
some cases, these were prompted by the reporting media themselves,
whereas others (as in the case of the Minister of Defence) were issued
on the initiative of the politician.

On 12 March, the Minister of Health and Care services, Bent Høie, warned
about spreading disinformation about the virus. His warning was
published i.a. by Norwegian broadcaster NRK: “We do not have a vaccine
against the virus, but we do not have a vaccine against fake news
either. In the same way that you spread the virus by not washing your
hands, you contribute to spreading uncertainty if you share false
advise”.[^278]

Minister of Defence, Frank Bakke-Jensen, issued a similar warning on 15
April, as reported in national newspaper Verdens Gang (VG). Pointing out
that the rivalisation between nations continued and that the threat to
Norway from external forces had not been affected by the coronavirus, he
quoted several instances of false information and voiced his concern
that Norway may become the target of coordinated attempts to influence
public opinion. “I note that many are spreading alternative theories for
infection prevention and methods, graphs and numbers on social media. I
would encourage sobriety, and it is smart to be sceptical”.[^279]

Press officer at the Oslo University Hospital, Anders Bayer, stated when
asked by newspaper VG whether there were already Norwegian Covid-19
patients in January: “That is not correct. This is ‘fake news’”. Later,
he continued: “At the emergency ward there is a great deal of
irritation, and we are sad that some people find it entertaining to
spread false rumors”.[^280]

**Portugal (a)**

A Portuguese politician, António Guterres, General-Secretary of the
United Nations Organization, welcomed "journalists and all those who
check the facts on the mountain of misleading stories and publications
on social networks", adding that the large companies that own these
networks must "do more to eliminate hatred and harmful statements
related to Covid-19”

Then YouTube announced the release of informative videos to demystify
rumors and disassemble dubious information, in particular on covid-19
pandemic.[^281] Facebook launched a campaign against disinformation in
Portugal, and surveys to assess what users have learned.[^282]

**Portugal (b)**

In our country each organization has established contingency plans
adapted to its reality within the general guidelines of the government
and especially of the Directorate General of Health.[^283]

**Serbia**

1.  Commissioner for Information on Public Importance and Personal Data
    Protection, Milan Marinkovic, in his public statement, condemned
    Covid-19-related disinformation through social media and called
    citizens not to accept news spread through social media lightly but
    to check their authenticity as much as possible.[^284]

2.  The public appeal of the Government of the Republic of Serbia to the
    citizens to stop spreading Covid-19-related disinformation through
    social media is available on its official website on Covid-19.[^285]

**South Africa**

In April 2020, Stephen Birch, a resident of Cape Town, posted a video
online claiming that the Covid testing kits were themselves contaminated
with Covid.[^286] He was arrested and charged with spreading
misinformation about Covid-19. The Western Cape provincial government
issued a statement reassuring the public that Birch’s information was
false. On the same day, the provincial government of Kwa- Zulu Natal
issued a press release reminding the public that it was an offence to
disseminate false information about Covid, and asking members of the
public to inform them if they discovered such information. News outlets
reported the Western Cape government’s debunking of Stephen Birch’s
video. President Cyril Ramaphosa denied reports that South Africa would
return to a stricter lockdown on 27 October 2020. This was also widely
reported in the media. When the media outlet ‘News24’ reported falsely
that Bill Gates was proposing to test a vaccine on Africans, Member of
Parliament Bantu Holomisa and Cabinet Member Fikile Mbalula called on
News24 to discipline the journalist who had produced the false report.
Politicians themselves have engaged in disputes with one another about
Covid-related information. There is currently a dispute between the
national Minister of Health and the Western Cape provincial government
on the Covid levels in the province.[^287]

**Spain**

While standard statements from politicians can be found stressing the
misleading effects of Covid-19 related disinformation,[^288] particular
attention was given to the Minister of Interior admitting that the
central government was monitoring the network ‘checking speeches that
may be dangerous or criminal’ as well as disinformation campaigns[^289].
Such a statement followed another where a high-ranked military official,
acting as spokesperson of the Ministry, had admitted that such a
strategy aimed at controlling messages potentially harmful for the
“government”[^290].

Opinions from headquarters are normally reproduced by local outlets and
Spanish representatives also share their strategy \[e.g. TW[^291], FB or
Google (7)\]. Beyond such statements, messages directly related to the
Spanish situation are rare, but a TW specific event was created
gathering information coming from Spanish health authorities[^292].
Moreover, given the vulnerability for cases of violence against women
caused by Covid-19 lockdown, Spain was the second country worldwide to
implement a TW alert containing official information and hot-lines. It
is displayed for searches related to such topics[^293]. On another note,
Instagram clarified that a confusion existed on the origin of problems
experienced by Covid19-related posts, whose author believed that the
platform was blocking a survey. The platforms declared that there were
just technical constraints related to the parameters applied to the
survey[^294].

Question 5: Can you find country-specific information on if, when and for how long the content-moderation workforce in your country has stopped its work during the pandemic and automated decision-making was increased? If yes, please cite the main points and indicate a source.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Albania:**

Mr. Semini commented: “*That was the case during the two-month lockdown
March-May period.”* However, it has not been possible to find specific
information/data on this matter.

Mr. Semini also added that *“due to the virus, e.g., all news
conferences are held with limited numbers of journalists. Often news
conferences are held online, a good way for any holder to avoid correct
answers or play as they may like to.” *

**Argentina:**

I haven´t found specific information on this topic

**Belgium**

In Belgium, the content-moderation workforce, and in particular the
DJSOC-i2-IRU unit of the federal police (see also *supra* question no.
4), did not stop its work during the pandemic. On the contrary, it
appointed a team of 21 investigators to search specifically for
Covid-19-related disinformation.[^295] In August, it was reported that,
since the beginning of the pandemic, 450 reports of disinformation had
been reported to the various social media platforms, of which 237 were
indeed removed.[^296]

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

I could not find any information that could be supported by a credible
source.

**Croatia**

No.

### Cyprus

No sources found.

**Denmark**

N/A

**Estonia**

There is no such information available.

**Finland**

No specific information on this point. 

**Germany**

No Germany-specific numbers/coverage in this regard. “Neither TikTok nor
YouTube or Twitter comment on how many content moderators are affected
and how this affects the teams in Germany.”[^297]

**Israel**

There is no specific information regarding content moderation workforce
in Israel

**Italy**

We don't think this was the case in Italy. By reading the Government's
released documents it seems that this was not really the case. But we
were not able to find specific information on that.

**Latvia**

No Latvia-specific numbers/coverage in this regard. However, the
independent fact-checkers continued their work all through the time of
the pandemic.

### Lithuania

We cannot find such information in relation to the pandemic. However,
debunk.eu (or demaskuok.lt) artificial intelligence-based fact-checking
platform which started before the pandemic continued its work also
during the pandemic. The artificial intelligence identifies potentially
most harmful articles. Internet elves and journalists then examine them
and rate them according to their harmfulness thus training the
artificial intelligence. Journalists then react to some of the
identified disinformation articles and publish their articles on
mainstream news portals. The head of this initiative, Viktoras Daukšas,
noted that Internet trolls produce so many articles that not all of them
can be deconstructed.[^298]

**Moldova**

No Moldova-specific numbers/coverage in this regard.

**Norway**

No Norway-specific numbers/coverage in this regard.

### 

### \
Portugal (a)

The "Polígrafo" (Polygraph) is an online journalistic project whose main
objective is to ascertain the truth and not the lie in the public space.
As of March 2, 2020, all content produced by the editorial staff of
"Polígrafo" on coronavirus is scientifically validated by the
Directorate-General for Health, the highest public health body in
Portugal.[^299] As of May 2020, the Whatsapp chatbot allows WhatsApp
users to detect fake news about Covid-19 according to the International
Fact Checking Network system. However, it is not available in
Portuguese.[^300]

### Portugal (b)

In Portugal we had the general confinement period from 13 March to 26
May 2020. From 27 May to date we have been working on the hybrid system
between Telework and Digital Work. Many organisations define this system
as Mirror Work. The source are measures and guidelines issued by the
Portuguese Government.[^301]

**Serbia**

No Serbia-specific data related to this issue.

**South Africa**

No.

**Spain**

According to the interviewed fact checking companies[^302], most of the
platforms’ efforts are global, although work teams have been
strengthened in Spain or collaboration with local fact checkers has been
promoted. Verification tasks did not come to a halt during the beginning
of the crisis, but on the contrary, it seems that it forced the
platforms to show greater concern. However, most automated efforts seem
to be global: chat bots, tightening of the rules for content removal,
etc.[^303]

\
Question 6: Has Covid-19 related disinformation in your country targeted certain groups within your country or abroad as “scapegoats”/supposed “perpetrators” behind Covid-19? If yes, please name the group(s) targeted the most and indicate a source.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Albania:**

At the moment there are no comprehensive scientific studies how
disinformation has further boosted existing prejudices. Nonetheless,
Albanian Media Institute (AMI) reports that Covid-19 conspiracy
theories, especially that of microchip vaccines (Bill Gates), are
currently circulating in Albania. According to AMI, various conspiracy
theories also found a place in the traditional media, as well as they
were multiplied by the social media.[^304] Prominent, for example, is
the explanation for this pandemic as a kind of war of armies based in
distant galaxies, and the coronavirus is a sophisticated weapon being
used to reduce the Earth's population sevenfold. One side of the war has
as its top representative on Earth President Trump, the good side, while
on the other side, the evil, is, George Soros.[^305]

Some media have also reported the opinions of Alfred Cako, publisher of
several books on conspiracy, who stated in a TV show that Covid-19 is a
biological weapon spread by the "Aryan Brotherhood”, the result of a
battle between the Illuminati and Donald Trump.[^306]

**Argentina**

Mainly, in Argentina, we can see daily cross accusations made between
politicians of the left and right, trying to generate popular discontent
with their opponents and gain votes. Other example are accusations made
by people linked to environmental movements, who raised concerns about
the effects that 5G technology could have on the body and linked them to
Covi-19disease. In Argentina, the first mentions appeared last February,
with notes that analyzed these conspiracy theories in other countries
and pointed out their falsehood. Unlike what happened in other
countries, there was no strong activity against 5G in Argentina before
the pandemic. Until February 2020, an analysis of Google searches (via
the Google Trends tool) shows relatively little interest in 5G, but then
the false theory that links the coronavirus with 5G arrived.[^307]

**Belgium**

In Belgium, Covid-19 related disinformation has targeted both the Muslim
community and migrants as “scapegoats”/ supposed “perpetrators” behind
Covid-19.

In a note[^308], issued on April 21^st^, 2020, the State Security
service found that a number of far-right groups engage in hate speech
against Muslims (p. 3). The example given refers to a message published
by the Frenchspeaking splinter party ‘Nation’ which stated that there
was a so-called Fatwa calling infected Muslims to “cough in the faces of
non-believers” (p. 3).

The same document also observed that right-wing extremists (whether or
not using a pro-Russian discourse) claim that there is a link between
the outbreak of the coronavirus and immigration (pp. 4-5). In
particular, it holds that “\[a\] mixture of facts, fake news and
far-right framing is used to make their message clear. It is the leading
discourse of the far right on social media, with one common denominator:
migration makes the outbreak of the coronavirus worse” (p. 4). Stating
that there are numerous examples, the note specifically references
statements made by the French-speaking far-right party Parti National
Européen (PNE), a breakaway party of the abovementioned party ‘Nation’
(p. 4). More specifically, PNE described an asylum centre in Mouscron as
being a source of infection for the surrounding area and demanded that
that the centre should be closed, adding that “they (the asylum seekers)
should all be accommodated in Parliament: the building does not serve
any meaningful purpose anyway” (p. 4).

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

The disinformation targeting certain groups could be found mostly on
individual social media profiles, or clickbait titles with conspiracy
theory related content. The groups mostly targeted were the Chinese, and
Asians in general, who were blamed for artificially creating the virus,
allowing it to escape from the laboratory, and not reacting in a timely
manner to prevent it from spreading to other parts of the world. There
are examples of stigmatisation and verbal attacks against Asian tourists
that may be attributed to the spread of disinformation.[^309] In
relation to this, a report aired on a private TV station that is fairly
popular country-wide showed a journalist reporting from the town of
Konjic which had an increase in the number of positive cases, dressed in
a fully body protective suit, referring to the city as a „Bosnian
Wuhan“.[^310] This was perceived as the stigmatisation of the entire
population of the town in question.

As in other countries, the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina were not
immune to blaming Microsoft's Bill Gates for the situation with regards
to the pandemic. Media outlets have tried to research about this issue
and inform the public in an objective and accurate way, but social media
and internet forums remained fruitful platforms for the spread of these
theories.[^311] The discussion around Bill Gates was often connected to
the allegations of health hazards of the 5G technology, with statements
that the pandemic is only used as a cover up for the adoption of the
5G.[^312]

There was some media reporting and social media posts about irregular
migrants' camps as hotspots of coronavirus infection, which triggered
additional stigmatisation of this group. Some sensationalistic media
reporting about migrants' camps in Italy that were identified as the
biggest European hotspots of infection additionally fuelled the spread
of disinformation.[^313]

Despite the fact that the society of BiH is deeply polarized along the
ethnic lines of three dominant (constituent) groups (Bosniak, Serb,
Croat) whose political representatives tend to place blame on other
groups for various challenges the country has been facing since the war
ended in 1995, there has been no scapegoating of other ethnic groups
with regards to the Covid-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had “a
paradoxical effect on the political dynamics” [^314] in the country
which is quite nationalism-prone, at least if the political rhetoric is
assessed.

**Croatia**

Not to my knowledge. There was a certain stigma against people who were
tested positive.

### Cyprus

6\. Even though there are not tangible elements about the impact of
Covid-19-related disinformation on certain social groups, it is admitted
that social vulnerable groups, such as homeless and minorities as well
as people from Asia or Africa, are the victims of this situation. As it
has been explicitly written, “Chinese people have been excluded, albeit
temporarily, from the wider world and have been characterized as the
different Others. Every Chinese is suspicious of carrying the deadly
disease so their social exclusion is legitimized” (Argyriadis, A., &
Argyriadi, A. (2020). Socio-Cultural Discrimination and the Role of
Media in the Case of the Coronavirus: Anthropological and Psychological
Notes through a Case Study. International Journal of Caring Sciences,
13(2), 1449).

**\
**

**Denmark**

The nationalistic parties "the Danish Peoples Party" and "the New order
party" incriminate people from non-western background and the spread of
the coronavirus in Denmark, although the hardest-hit municipalities are
of Danish origin.[^315] “Meat-eaters” have been attacked as well.[^316]

**Estonia**

As mentioned above, there is anti-foreigner rhetoric used in Covid-19
disinformation. Several news items on uueduudised.ee emphasise the role
of foreigners (e.g. international students or foreign farm workers) in
spreading the disease.[^317]

**Finland**

Finland has received similar disinformation as the rest of the EU.
Finnish government has collected monthly summary on Covid 19, which
always includes section on disinformation.[^318]

**Germany**

Covid-19 has boosted existing prejudices. Although there are at the
moment no comprehensive scientific studies, media reports show that the
virus has been included in anti-Semitic conspiracy theories[^319] and
reinforced racist discrimination in Germany, especially against people
of Asian descent.[^320] Another prominent myth is the involvement of
Bill and Melinda Gates.[^321]

**Israel**

Covid-19 had increased racist discrimination towards Asian people in
Israel, this has to do with one of the greater conspiracies regarding
Covid-19 in Israel, whereby the coronavirus is a biological weapon
developed by China.[^322]

**\
Italy**

There have been episodes of accusation against Asian tourists.[^323]
Other cases have been registered against migrants, especially those who
trespass illegally the country borders.[^324] Other cases have been
shown concerning Italians abroad, especially in the early months of the
pandemic, as resulting from a declaration of the Italian Ministry for
Foreign Affairs.[^325]

More generally, some studies show that subjects prone to depression,
disappointment, suspicion, and religious fundamentalism are targeted by
those who distribute fake news. This, in turn, contributed to the
scapegoat phenomenon described above.[^326] This seems to be the case in
Italy as well, but also age plays a relevant role.[^327]

**Latvia**

Surveys reveal that approximately half of the citizens of Latvia believe
that Covid-19 was created in the laboratory[^328], presumably either in
the USA[^329] or China. Although at the moment there are no
comprehensive scientific studies, comments at the articles on Covid-19
reveal racist slogans against the people from Asia.[^330] Also the
distributor of fake news Niks Endziņš in his posts of January 2020 asked
for "elimination" of China and its citizens in connection to their
"role" in the spreading of the new virus.[^331] Additionally, many users
are convinced that the pandemic is a project of Bill Gates in order to
chip the people or get financial benefits.[^332]

### \
Lithuania

NATO troops, especially African American service personnel among
American troops, but also German troops were portrayed as those
spreading the disease.[^333] Bill Gates[^334] and 5G[^335] were also
mentioned.

**Moldova**

In Moldova among other fake stories, it has been suggested that former
Prime Minister Maia Sandu asked the EU to impose an embargo on Moldovan
products, and alleged that Moldova and Armenia are subjected to total
aggression led by the “George Soros Monster”, and that Coronavirus is
just a lie.[^336]

The Republic of Moldova was exposed to two main narratives during the
COVID-19 pandemic[^337]: a widespread circulation of conspiracy theories
and the use of the health crisis by Russia and, secondarily, by China to
promote their own agendas and to undermine European solidarity.

A significant number of media websites, marginal politicians, but also
conspiracy movements already present in Chisinau or religious figures
disseminated conspiracy theories refuting the severity of the COVID-19
pandemic. Some of the most “popular” theories heavily circulated in the
Republic of Moldova include: the link between the COVID-19 pandemic and
the installation of 5G antennas meant to subsequently control the
population, nanochipping of the population by vaccination, or the
existence of a global conspiracy, led by Bill Gates, aimed at decimating
the population. A series of articles by Report.md revealed the
considerable influence of these narratives on the population. A recent
analysis by WatchDog.md points out that at least 1 in 3 Moldovans
believes one of these theories[^338].

**Norway**

There have not been any attempts to target specific groups within
Norway, at least not by mainstream media. Early in the pandemic, a story
was spread that the virus was a biological weapon produced by the USA to
impact the Chinese economy. This was one of the cases that caused the
Minister of Defence to warn against targeted misinformation campaigns
directed at Norway.[^339]

The Norwegian government has recently become a target, not as a
perpetrator or scapegoat behind Covid-19 per se, but for using Covid-19
restrictions to push a political agenda and increase their power. On
Sunday 25 October, approximately 150 people gathered in front of the
parliament to protest the government’s handling of the Covid-19. The
initiator of the protests, Nader Eide, believes the pandemic is a bluff,
pre-planned and that face masks do not work.[^340]

### Portugal (a)

The "theory" of the "Chinese virus" has been widely diffused and echoed
by Portuguese media.[^341]

**Serbia**

Covid-19 related disinformation is very often connected with prejudices
and conspiracy theories. The person most often mentioned in Serbia as
the culprit for the pandemic is Bill Gates, Microsoft’s founder.[^342]
Some disinformation is racist-based, targeting in particular migrants,
while some Covid-19 related prejudices are political, as is a belief
that ‘NATO wants to destroy Serbia.’[^343] There are also allegations of
the connection between 5G networks and the Corona virus pandemic.^12^

**South Africa**

Targets of misinformation include China, the USA, Bill Gates and the
‘Illuminati’. The misinformation on social media includes claims that:
Covid-19 was manufactured as a bio-weapon in China; Covid was
manufactured as a bio-weapon in the United States of America; Bill Gates
has proposed to test his vaccines in Africa, thus using Africa as
‘laboratory rats’; Bill Gates engineered Covid in order to force
everybody to submit to a vaccination. When the vaccination is carried
out, a microchip will be inserted into every vaccinated person; Bill
Gates invented either the virus or the vaccine in order to kill
Africans, as he wants to ‘depopulate’ Africa; Covid-19 was created by
the ‘New World Order’ or ‘Illuminati’ in order to dominate the globe.
There has also been hostility expressed at the government itself, for
its lockdown regulations, and the tracing app that it has
introduced.[^344]

**Spain**

In the networks, disinformation statements range from the virus arising
as a result of a plot to destroy humanity to a way of getting
benefits[^345], pointing to alleged links between the pandemic and 5G as
a pretext to establish the global domain in which the attacked group are
economic elites (p. 39)[^346]. Bill Gates is accused as an outsider of a
plot that intends to control the world with a chip[^347]. He receives
accusations from popular Spanish singers such as Miguel Bosé and Bunbury
(Enrique Ortiz de Landázuri Izarduy)[^348]. As an internal agent, the
Spanish government has also been accused as the "sole responsible for
the deaths, (...) it had destroyed the Spanish economy by locking up the
population, giving rise to an infodemic of hoaxes."[^349] Likewise,
youth has been accused as a propagating agent of the virus: "the current
stigmatizing discourse of youth and the night shows the inability of an
adult-centered society to propose scenarios for the future and
possibility that can counteract the boredom of a generation."[^350]

Finally, within denialist movements or those that support conspiracy
theories, the anti-vaccine movements have a large role and some of the
public figures already mentioned are part of them. Besides, denialist
theses seem to be supported bygroups with extreme ideologies (left and
right)[^351].

\
Question 7: Have there been court cases on Covid-19-related content that was removed or not removed, including health-related disinfor­mation and information related to protests? 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Albania**

To the information available thus far, there are no court cases on
Covid-19-related content.

During the pandemic period, the government in Albania imposed
forgiveness of fines for 7100 citizens. The Technical Committee of
Experts serves as a reference point for institutions and the public. The
Technical Committee submits public reports which are made available,
offers analysis of the situation, conducts press conferences and
official recommendations which serve as a basis for any decision-making
process.[^352] Covid-19 has had to some extent an impact on the activity
of the judicial system, however measures to ensure continuation are put
in place.[^353]

**Argentina**

Not yet in Argentina as far as I know.

**Belgium**

No. The Belgian courts seem to mainly focus on the offline enforcement
of the restrictions taken to contain the virus. As such, a man who was
caught violating the corona rules no less than fourteen times had to
appear in court.[^354] As part of the most recent measures taken (16
October 2020), several business owners affected by the closure of the
bars and restaurants over the next four weeks also announced that they
would refer their case to the Council of State and call for an
accelerated review of this measure.[^355]

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

Freedom of expression online is still not specifically regulated across
the country, which makes it almost impossible for authorities to
regulate the spread of disinformation or hate speech online. Criminal
prosecution is usually limited to the offence of inciting religious and
ethnic hatred through the internet or social networks.

As a result, there have been no cases of the removal the removal of the
Covid – 19- related content. There are, however, some examples of
misdemeanour warrants issued against individuals for violating laws on
public peace and order and the law decrees enacted in Republika Srpska
to fight the transmission of information that may cause panic or
severely violate public peace and order by spreading “fake news” about
the virus in the media and on social networks. [^356]

**Croatia**

By June 2020 there have been 32 charges brought for spreading fake news
about Covid 19.[^357] In Croatia it is a criminal act (misdemeanour).

### Cyprus

7\. Not to our knowledge. But we shall re-underline the survey on posts
on social media networks and news sites claiming that the pandemic is
essentially a conspiracy, urging people to refuse to accept fines and
sanctions and to disobey restrictions to contain a further spread. This
act consists an infringement of specific provisions of the Penal Code of
the Republic of Cyprus.

**Denmark**

No that we are aware of.

**Estonia**

There is no such information available.

**Finland**

No.

**Germany**

Not to our knowledge. All adjudication available at this time is heavily
centered around the offline consequences of and protection measures
against the pandemic, i.e. bans on demonstrations and other social
gatherings and closing businesses. However, there are some media reports
on the prosecution of Covid-19 “skeptics”, who may have committed a
criminal offence pursuant to § 111 (1) StGB (public provocation to
commit an offence) by rallying for prohibited protests.[^358] There may
be a larger number of these kinds of offences and, consequentially,
deletions of unlawful content as a reaction to government requests. It
will be interesting to see whether the takedown numbers under Germany’s
NetzDG, the Network Enforcement Act, will substantially increase.

**\
**

**Israel**

Not yet, but according to several media reports, the State Attorney's
Office is considering prosecute citizens who sent false messages to
other citizens on the behalf of Ministry of Health.[^359] In addition
the police is investigating over 50 citizens regarding spreading
disinformation about Covid-19.[^360]

**Italy**

Not yet

**Latvia**

On 30 July 2020 the Criminal Court approved the agreement between the
prosecutor and the accused regarding the commission of the criminal
offence provided for in Section 231, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law.
The criminal act - disturbance of public order, manifested in an
apparent disrespect for society, ignoring generally accepted norms of
behaviour and disrupting the work of human beings and institutions
(hooliganism) – was carried out by posting fake news, among other
things, regarding Covid-19, on a specifically created webpage.[^361] The
journalists had investigated that the distribution of these articles
happens mostly on Facebook, where the primary sharers are fake
profiles.[^362] However, the decision does not contain any restrictions
regarding the website as such or any comments regarding the distribution
of these news in social networks.

As a reaction to these news several Saeima deputies prompted creating
new Criminal law norms, which would provide for criminal liability for
distributing fake news with financial intents.[^363] Additionally, in
January 2020 another distributor of fake news Niks Endziņš published on
his Facebook profile a video in wish he states that the first patient
with Covid-19 has already entered Latvia and notes that "in general, the
Chinese \[censored\] should be eliminated, their country needs to be
eliminated." While the publisher of the video was arrested for inciting
national and ethnic hate in the social media, the video was taken off
from his page after his own initiative or through the actions of social
media monitoring teams[^364], without a need for a specific court
decision.

### Lithuania

We cannot identify such cases.

**Moldova**

No information in this regard.

**Norway**

There do not seem to have been any such cases in Norway to date.

### Portugal

The Portuguese Regulatory Authority of Media has issued an alert to all
establishments providing healthcare, intervening in health advertising
practices and to users in general, about misleading advertising or
undermining users' rights, recalling, in particular, that advertising
practices are prohibited in that conceal, mislead or deceive about the
main characteristics of the act or service, that falsely refer to
demonstrations or guarantees of cure or results or without adverse or
secondary effects or that induce users to unnecessary, harmful or
undiagnosed consumption or previous evaluation by a qualified
professional.[^365]

**Serbia**

To our knowledge, no court decision on Covid-19-related disinformation
has been delivered. Media has reported several arrests and investigating
proceedings against persons who may have committed a criminal offense
under Article 343 of the Serbian Criminal Code (Causing Panic and
Disorder by disclosing or disseminating untrue information or
allegations through media or at the public gathering).^13^

**South Africa**

We cannot find any court cases relating to information about Covid.
There are a number of Covid-related court cases, but most of these
relate to the anti-Covid measures taken by government and not Covid
itself, and, once again, do not deal with information about these
measures. The court challenges have criticised the lockdown regulations
as irrational, too strict or too lenient; some have claimed an exemption
from the regulations and others have dealt with financial relief for
loss of income due to the lockdown. There have been several claims
against the law enforcement officials, which include the National
Defence Force of the country.[^366]

**Spain**

Regarding Court cases related to the removal of Covid-19 related
information from social platforms, a Spanish citizen was brought to
Court on the basis of a YouTube video where he declared that he was
arriving from Madrid to Torrevella (Alacant) and wanted people living
there to be infected. As an interim measure and given the menace to the
public safety, the judge retained his passport and forced him to leave
the city[^367]. A similar case occurred in Ceuta where a person spread
via Facebook false information about a worrisome Covid-19 situation in
the local prison.[^368] A 360€ fine was imposed on the grounds of
defamation of civil servants.

Along these lines, the Spanish Public Attorney (*Fiscalía*) released a
report where Covid-19 related disinformation was connected to different
criminal offences[^369] and the police, initiated proactive
investigations in this regard (see declarations in Andalucia[^370]).

Beyond the judiciary, actions have been taken by the public
administration through other means. The Catalan Audiovisual Commission
(CAC) requested the removal of 16 YouTube vídeos and the platform
proceeded accordingly with 14 of such cases[^371]. Moreover, an
agreement was signed between CAC and regional health authorities aiming
at addressing health disinformation on all media including
platforms[^372]. The *Guardia Civil*, one of the Spanish police corps,
created a special email account for Covid-19 frauds[^373].

There are also instances (e.g. YouTube[^374]) where the removal has been
approved by the platforms themselves with no prior institutional
intervention.

Question 8: Has there been a discussion in your country on how private actors can (or should) enforce public rules (laws) in relation to Covid-19? 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: In Germany, there was a discussion on whether the railway company
can enforce mask-wearing obligations which were provided not in their
terms of service but by local and regional laws. Railway employees
argued that they could not enforce the norms, but would only be able to
call for police at the next stop.

[]{#_vx3rijc68z5y .anchor}

**Albania:**

There are calls made by the Prime Minister of Albania calling on the
individual and public contribution to fight against Covid-19.[^375]

There is unfortunately a political debate on the use of the masks. The
opposition leader of one of the parties, calls on all Albanians to not
implement the decision and to not wear masks in a challenge to the
government in place.[^376] Nonetheless, there have been widespread calls
from different health personnel pushing forward the usage of masks. In
this regard, fines are introduced which vary from 3,000ALL the first
time to 5,000ALL the second time and the money is collected through the
family’s monthly power consume bill.

In the private sector, the government introduced some rules and measures
for masks, social distancing, disinfectants and the way to organize the
studies. Specifically, a protocol of security was created putting an
obligation on all the public and private institutions. Some of the
provisions taken by the government, especially by the Ministry of
Education, Sports and Youth, regarding both private education
institutions and private high education institutions are:

a)  Common guide for home learning due to the situation created by the
    spread of Covid-19 which provide platforms for online teaching and
    the modalities of online teaching (30.03.2020).[^377]

b)  Guidelines on the mandatory use of masks outdoors, which means the
    enforceability of this order for public and private education
    institutions.[^378]

**Argentina:**

Yes, for example regarding measures that impact on labor law.[^379] But
there are no court cases yet.

**Belgium**

In Belgium, there has been little discussion on how private actors can
(or should) enforce public rules (laws) in relation to Covid-19.

Indeed, at the time when the wearing of mouth masks in stores became
mandatory, former Prime Minister, Sophie Wilmès, said that: “From the
beginning of the crisis, we have seen that the Belgian people follow the
rules. I expect nothing else today. The shopkeepers shouldn't play
policeman. We count on the common sense of the people”.[^380] At the
same time, she stated that the rule would be enforced: “There may be a
fine if you do not follow that measure”.[^381]

It may also be mentioned that the municipal council of Knokke-Heist
complained that the railway company, the NMBS/SNCB, did not sufficiently
enforce the applicable mask-wearing obligations, accusing it of
consciously organizing the export of Covid-19 to the seaside.[^382] A
spokesperson of the NMBS/SNCB – which, in any case, is a state-owned
company – countered that: “Wearing a mouth mask has been mandatory since
4 May. This is checked by our people and by the railway police. There is
also a major awareness-raising campaign going on".[^383]

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

There is an ongoing discussion on how recommendations and obligations to
implement various epidemiological measures (social-distancing, wearing
of masks, scanning for increased body temperature) are to be implemented
by schools and kindergartens, including private education institutions,
especially as some parents’ groups and organisations have been strongly
opposing the implementation of such measures.[^384] There has also been
a discussion on whether these institutions are allowed to share personal
information with public authorities of children and their family members
who have been ordered to self-isolate.

There was some discussion on whether public authorities could prohibit
gatherings inside religious objects, including churches and mosques, as
private facilities. In statements by some religious leaders, this was
put into the context of restricting the right to freedom of religion of
belief.[^385]

**\
Croatia**

Most of the measures have been recommendations. The drivers of public
buses are not entitled to enforce them by force.[^386]

### Cyprus

8\. There is not a specific policy about this issue, however the Office
of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection of the Republic of
Cyprus has announced specific guidelines regarding the adoption of
several measures by private institutions in order to combat the spread
of Covid in accordance to those guidelines adopted by the EPDB (European
Protection Data Board).[^387]

**Denmark**

The Danish Working Environment Authority, in collaboration with the
Danish Agency for Patient Safety have reached common agreements on the
guidelines for work environments.[^388] Most private offices have
created their own set of covid-guidelines.[^389]

**Estonia**

There has been widespread discussion about how nightclubs and bars
attempt to circumvent the prohibition of selling alcohol from the
midnight. There is also discussion of whether transportation companies’
employees have the responsibility to enforce mask-wearing obligations.
Tallinn city government has the view that the responsibility of such
enforcement does not rely upon private actors. The public discussion
around mask-wearing has an aspect of legality (which is overshadowed by
the medical aspect – that is whether the mask-wearing results in better
protection) – in the other words, whether there exists sufficient legal
basis for the government to impose mask-wearing obligation, whether the
legislature should have passed specific regulation allowing the
government to impose such regulation, or whether discretion to impose
such requirement can be directly derived from the national constitution.

**Finland**

No. Only recommendations

**Germany**

Apart from the enforcement discussion regarding the railway company
mentioned in the question,[^390] there has been no comparable discourse.
The railway company has, as of now, not given in to demands to establish
a private-law contractual fine against travelers not wearing masks.
Employees are asked only to call the police at the next stop, if the
person in question “repeatedly refuses” to put the mask on.[^391]

**Israel**

There was a similar discussion in Israel on whether the railway company
can enforce the mask-wearing obligation. Although the railway company
has provided it's own stuff that is in charge to inform the passengers
regarding social distance and mask-wearing obligations, the stuff does
not have an enforcement authority.  Businesses (such as stores) were
required to enforce laws within the store such as mask wearing, max.
number of people and keeping distances. The Stores were fined and
potentially closed if found that they allowed customers to break the
rules.

**Italy**

Yes, there is a lively scholarly and policy-makers' debate on this
issue.

Many concerns have been raised as regards the adoption of a contact
exposure app called “immuni” for the involvement of a private company in
the software deployment. The fact that the download is voluntary by the
user has been clarified by the Italian Data Protection Authority only
with the decree of 17 October, deputies of healthcare agencies and
departments have been forced to use the data of exposure notification
which were collected by the application. Before there were many cases in
which they were simply ignored.[^392] Another relevant issue was the
adoption of company-owned applications to control the health condition
of employees. The Data Protection Authority has issued a statement in
order to safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms of workers.[^393]

**Latvia**

The people who disagree with the duty to wear masks also debate on the
rights of the guards to prohibit them from entering the premises. [^394]
At the same time also the government put the responsibility for the
compliance with the epidemiological safety measures introduced for
Covid-19, i.e., the use of face masks by the visitors, on the shops and
businesses, but did not formulate how such responsibility manifests
itself.

What concerns the use of masks in shops and other private institutions,
it must be noted that not all places actively prohibit entering people
without masks.[^395] At the same time there has been a case where a
security guard allegedly sprayed tear gas in the face of the man who
refused to comply with the duty to wear the mask and after a demand to
do so acted violently.[^396] This case has been widely discussed in the
social media and the people once again have divided into two
groups.Similarly, also the duty to wear masks in public transport and
other places has been doubted as being in violation of Oviedo convention
or being illegal due to other grounds. At least 15 thousand people have
shared Facebook videos and photos stating that the duty to wear masks in
public transport is illegal.[^397] Other arguments[^398] are that the
demand to leave the vehicle breaches the right to freedom (Article 94 of
the Constitution) and that the people have the rights to use the ticket
they have paid for.[^399]

The Cabinet of Ministers has explained that, if the passenger refuses to
wear a face mask, the driver or controller has the right to refuse to
board or to ask to leave the vehicle.[^400] Also, police will be
involved in those controls.[^401] That is directly stated in the Cabinet
of Ministers Regulation No. 599 "Procedures for Provision and Use of
Public Transport Services." However, it must be noted that, for example,
"Rīgas Satiksme" is a municipally-owned public transportation and
infrastructure company in Riga; similarly, also the only
passenger-carrying railway company "Pasažieru Vilciens" is an
independent state-owned company. Thus, one cannot speak of absolutely
private actors who will enforce these regulations.

### Lithuania

Not to our knowledge. However, the question of cooperation between the
central and municipal authorities gave rise to some debate. Creation of
an effective mechanism of cooperation with municipalities was included
into the Plan of Implementation of the Covid-19 Management Strategy
adopted by the Government on 10/06/2020.[^402]

**\
Moldova**

During the state of emergency periods, the civil society and the media
institutions managed a series of actions[^403]: i) reversing the
decisions of the governmental bodies to introduce journalistic
self-censorship; ii) advocating for the adopting of the new NGO law;
iii) speaking out against intimidation of the constitutional judges; iv)
holding accountable the PM Ion Chicu, the President Igor Dodon and other
officials for controversial attitudes of blaming the medical staff,
tolerating breaching of the rules by church clergy or of misinforming
about external aid.

The central authorities have shown a disproportional approach concerning
the fair assessment of the external aid. Thus, the most advertised
assistance has been the Russian one, even if it consisted of tests and
air transportation of medical goods acquired from China. Regardless that
the Chinese support included procured goods, it benefited from
overwhelming positive remarks from the Moldovan top officials. By
contrast, even though the government commended the 3,5 million EUR worth
humanitarian aid from Romania, the ceremony and other technical
procedures of the receiving were not smooth. In general, the authorities
have emphasized the received assistance from countries with friendlier
regimes – Hungary, Turkey, China or Russia. Others were communicated
less intensely or shorter in time. The aid from the EU has been among
the least promoted one. The Moldovan side claimed that the EU promised
financial aid (approx. 190 million EUR of grants and macro-financial
assistance) but it has not yet materialized. The particularities of the
EU bureaucracy did not permit a quick disbursement of its aid, which
underlined the difference between the committed aid of the EU and the
actually disbursed one. This has clearly required better communication
of the EU to cancel both the misinterpretations and the too high
expectations[^404].

According to a report by Asociația Promo-LEX, National Endowment for
Democracy: “As a result of the policy of repression in the Transnistrian
separatist region within the Republic of Moldova *(author’s note: please
see below the Question 11, (B) Key challenge)*, in the context of the
decisions taken by the Tiraspol administration, the first incidents
occurred. On April 7, 2020, the Interior Ministry announced that a
person from the town of Grigoriopol risks up to 5 years in prison for
allegedly calling for aggression. From the published press release, it
is observed that this person would have forwarded a message via
messenger, which s/he would have received in turn. The message advised
people not to open the doors to the Transnistrian militia (a.n. police)
and not to agree to a hypothetical vaccination against COVID-19. In the
absence of transparency, such a case can be considered at the limit of
freedom of expression. Furthermore, the criminal punishment of 5 years
of deprivation of liberty for such a message seems to be an unjustified
measure. In addition, this case reflects an obvious interference with
the protection of personal data, taking into account the verification
and supervision of messenger chats, which are a private means of
communication.

At the end of April 2020, two people were detained for allegedly
criticizing the latest actions of the Tiraspol regime during the
pandemic, but also the economic and social situation in the region, in
one of the groups on the Viber application. In connection with these
actions, the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region became active
online and addressed dozens of requests to the constitutional
authorities, NGOs, but also to the media in the Republic of Moldova.
According to some sources, one person was released two days after his
detention, and the other person was given the measure of pre-trial
detention.”[^405] (author’s own translation from Romanian)

**Norway**

There has been a debate whether the state-owned public transportation
companies Ruter (bus and tram operator in Oslo) and Vy (railway company)
can enforce regulations regarding mandatory use of face masks on public
transportation.[^406] On Vy’s and Ruter’s electronic information boards
and posters inside metros and buses, they encouraged everyone to use
face masks on public transportation, even before it was made mandatory
on the municipal level.[^407] A part of the debate is how the injunction
will be enforced.

With new recommendations regarding face masks issued in the beginning of
November, the question was also raised how shop attendants should deal
with customers who refuse to comply with the regulations.[^408] The
matter became particularly complicated by the unclear phrasing of the
regulation, which originally made face masks mandatory in public in all
situations where one meter distance to others could not be maintained,
such as in shopping centres. The question then arose how to deal with
customers who claimed they *could* maintain proper distance and
therefore refused to wear a mask. Also, restaurant staff in Oslo have
pointed out that they are not police and should not be put in a position
where they have to be law enforcers.[^409] The issue has been
particularly debated in Oslo due to the more restrictive measures in
force there.

### Portugal (a)

The General-Direction of Health issued guidelines procedures for
prevention, control and surveillance of Covid-19 in companies. The
Covid-19 pandemic is considered a matter of health safety for workers
and therefore employers have to implement such procedures. The Health
Authority is held responsible only for intervening in situations of
serious risk to Public Health, monitoring the health of citizens and the
health level of services and establishments and determining, when
necessary, corrective measures, including the interruption or suspension
of activities or services and the closure of establishments.[^410] A
Portuguese court ordered release of quarantined person in an Azores
hotel.[^411] Further reference to the judgement from the Portuguese
Constitutional Court *Acórdão n.º 424/2020, 31/07*[^412], kindly
provided by our colleague Paula Veiga. Declaring unconstitutional the
provisions of the Azorean regional regulation upon which passengers
arriving at the Region had to stay in compulsory quarantine. It does not
concern directly disinformation but nonetheless the rational is
excessive restriction of basic rights.

### Portugal (b)

Yes, there was a strong partnership relationship with the Public
Security Police. Multi­disciplinary intervention teams were also created
from nearby communities most affected by Covid-19. There was good
coordination between the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry
of Infrastructure.[^413]

**Serbia**

There has been no discussion regarding the enforcement of general rules
related to the Covid-19 by private actors in Serbia. Despite the
paramount importance of protecting human health, life, and safety during
the Covid-19 pandemic, private actors have no authority to enforce the
norms concerning the Covid-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Labor of the
Republic of Serbia adopted a set of rules for employers concerning the
Covid-19 epidemic. The Rulebook on preventive measures for safe and
healthy work to prevent the occurrence and spread of an epidemic of
infectious diseases applies to all workplaces where the job is
performed, except for the field jobs and working from home.[^414]
However, the Rulebook does not provide enforcement of rules by private
actors.

**South Africa**

There has not been much of a discussion as those private actors who have
sought to enforce the public rules have mostly taken action to do so and
have not been strongly opposed. Many retailers are requesting phone
numbers and the use of hand sanitizers and mask wearing before allowing
entry. In March 2020, the government introduced a limit of 100 people
allowed in stores at the same time. Since this coincided with the
introduction of lockdown and a rush on retailers, this policy required
enforcement and many retailers did so themselves. Private individuals
have been instrumental in fighting misinformation on social media, as
noted above.[^415]

**Spain**

Spain, as a country where the tertiary sector has a fundamental weight
in the economy, has had different controversies regarding the
application of health regulations by entrepreneurs and private agents.
Probably the most controversial business sector is the nightlife one,
which due to diverse regional and state legislation has had great
restrictions in view of the difficulty of its control. The controversy
has become so great that in cities where health measures are more
invasive, such as Granada whose University's rectorate has called for
institutional hardening of nightlife measures, given the risk of
contagion among the young population. [^416] In a way the press
emphasizes the fact that nightlife is difficult to control in itself.
[^417]

On the other hand, the National Federation of Entertainment and Show
Businesses, representative of the sector's entrepreneurs, has criticized
the hardening of the measures and rejected accusations to their
behaviour, as they consider that actions taken are disproportionate. The
sector would already have mechanisms to comply with the prevention of
contagion.[^418] This is perhaps the most emblematic debate, accentuated
by the generation gap. But others can be pointed out, such as the lack
of control of hotels during the summer season with respect to
international tourist traffic in cities in southern Spain.

Question 9: Have online platforms been used to disseminate governmental or municipal measures including restrictions and/or suggestions as a response to the spread of the epidemic?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Albania

### Yes, they have been the main distributors of information following the TV channels. Facebook and WhatsApp have been widely used in this regard. Firstly, the most common online platforms used during the pandemic are official websites of the Council of Ministers, Ministry of Health and Social Protection, Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports. Also, for each of these institutions there are official Facebook pages, through which announcements are published. 

### 

### Orders and instructions on measures taken in the pandemic are set out on the official website of the ministries. On the official page of the Council of Ministers, we can find all the news and measures taken for the pandemic situation. 

### Argentina

Yes, nearly all the three states levels (national, provincial and
municipal) created specific contents on their portals containing
specific information on these topics. Also at a national level the
"CuidAr" app was created and also has their own all the provinces (for
example "Covi-19- Provincia de Santa Fe").

**Belgium**

Although new measures were published on government websites and often
explained during press conferences, they were not always understandable
for the average Belgian citizen. In that context, some members of
parliament used online platforms to disseminate more accessible
overviews of the governmental restrictions.[^419] As mentioned above
(see *supra* no. 3), the Belgian authorities have collaborated with
online platforms such as Facebook and Twitter to promote government
information concerning the pandemic.[^420]

The Flemish government, on the initiative of the Minister for Media,
Benjamin Dalle (CD&V), used, among others, social media to disseminate a
number of campaigns aimed at containing the coronavirus.[^421] In
particular, it paid for advertisements, launched hashtags and, with a
view to reach young people, relied on influencers to spread the
word.[^422] The Flemish public broadcaster, VRT, also has published
accessible Frequently-Asked-Questions lists on its website,[^423] and
uses Instagram to communicate news – including news about the pandemic –
to young people and children via the accounts @nws.nws.nws and
@karrewietketnet.

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

Yes, media outlets disseminated the information about governmental
measures through online platforms, in particular orders and
recommendations issued by crisis headquarters at all levels. In
addition, a large number of governmental bodies, local self-governance
units, and public institutions created new profiles on social media
platforms, or started using their existing profiles more actively to
disseminate new decisions. This was mostly done through Facebook, and
some municipalities and their civil protection services disseminated
information through already existing applications or created new ones
for the purpose of informing the citizens about the Covid-19 related
measures.[^424]

**Croatia**

The Government of Croatia has launched an official website for timely
and accurate information on coronavirus available under the following
link: www.koronavirus.hr. The website provides information on
coronavirus, adopted government measures and initiatives to tackle the
crisis, instructions for citizens as well as warnings about certain
cases of misinformation present in the public and on social networks
e.g. warning about the inefficiency of home-made hands sanitizers or
false “recipes” to cure coronavirus.[^425] 

### Cyprus

At this point, we could give a special emphasis on the dissemination of
the national laws and rules concerning the pandemic, by the online
platforms of the universities, private and public. Moreover, all the
health protocols adopted by the educational institutions are in line
with the national measures and rules. Finally, we could mention the
intensive use of Facebook and other social media through which the
government intends to raise public awareness about the expansion of the
pandemic (https://www.facebook.com/PIOCy/. (press and information office
of the Republic of Cyprus).

**Denmark**

Yes, the government use social media actively to publish new guidelines
and clarify false rumors. The Twitter account of the danish healthcare
secretary can be consulted at https://twitter.com/SSTSundhed.

**Estonia**

The most detailed information regarding Covid-19 measures are published
on governmental websites. Summaries of those measures are usually
displayed on news platforms and social media (government’s,
municipalities’ and Health Board’s own pages and other pages – e.g.
newspapers, interest groups). There is no legal or administrative
obligation for news platforms to display this information, but as there
is great public interest in the matter, this is done daily.

**Finland**

Finland has worked together with social media influencers and
established \#faktaakoronasta, which means that social media influencers
receive weekly information package. This has done in co-operation with
THL (Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare) and PingHelsinki[^426]
The number of influencers were 1800. The Hashtag Twitter and Instagram
reached 4 million. 

**Germany**

While new and emergency rules were published on (local, regional,
federal) government websites, platforms were used to disseminate more
accessible overviews of the governmental restrictions and suggestions by
many *Länder* governments through their respective Minister-Presidents.
This includes the Minister-Presidents of the four most populous states
Armin Laschet (North Rhine-Westphalia),[^427] Markus Söder
(Bavaria),[^428] Winfried Kretschmann (Baden-Wuerttemberg)[^429], and
Stephan Weil (Lower Saxony)[^430]. Next to this adapted use of
preexisting channels, the measures globally rolled out by platforms were
applied in Germany, too (e.g. free ad space for health organizations,
featured context-specific links to official information sources,
“information centers” on Covid-19 with collections of official
communication on the situation et cetera, see also the answer at 3).

**Israel**

Yes. The Ministry of Health created an "information dashboard" - a
detailed website providing updates, including pushes etc. Other
platforms were also used. All news site dedicated space to covid-19
info. 

**Italy**

Yes, Facebook has been used by the Government itself. In many cases the
provisions were announced combining traditional mass media announcements
and web streaming. 

**Latvia**

Yes, social networks have been significant for the dissemination of the
official information. For example, the Twitter account of the Centre for
Disease Prevention and Control is the place where every day the newest
data on the positive tests is published.[^431] Therefore, this Twitter
account has become the leading and primary source of information.
Additionally, Twitter has become a favourite platform for the
communication and even active discussions with the representatives of
the Government of Latvia, i.e., Minister of Health Ilze Viņķele
regarding the Covid-19 measures.[^432] Government, ministries and local
municipalities have also prepared materials specifically suitable for
the social networks (Twitter and Facebook) regarding the measures.[^433]

All press conferences which took place during the pandemic were filmed
and shown in real-time in the profiles of Health Ministry, State
television and other relevant actors. Thus the people could follow them
in social media and also comment as the debates unveil.[^434]

Latvian state television also uses Instagram to rebuke fake news[^435]
in its Stories and to share news as Instagram posts.[^436]

**Lithuania**

Yes. The Government and the Ministry of Health publishes information on
their websites and Facebook accounts. The dedicated website
www.koronastop.lt was created and a chatbot[^437] was added to it. Press
conferences of the State Commander of National Emergency Operations on
the Covid-19 were broadcast live on the national television, radio and
online during the quarantine.

According to a survey conducted by “Synopticum”, in April 2020, 7 out of
10 respondents said it was important to them that Lithuanian state
authorities and leaders actively publish information on social media
regarding Covid-19 virus and measures taken regarding it. Only one half
of respondents considered that institutions communicated on social media
in an effective manner. One third of respondents thought they did it
ineffectively. Of the Covid-19 related information published on social
media, the respondents were mainly interested in facts on spread of the
virus in Lithuanian and curbing the pandemic (61%), decisions of
Lithuanian politicians in this situation (59%) and news on academic
research on the subject of the virus (58%).[^438]

**Moldova**

In Moldova, the pandemic response and its coverage in the media have
been highly politicized. The general political competition in the
country had its negative effect and led to an increased level of
misinformation and manipulation with information. Russian and Chinese
disinformation campaigns and media influence have been noticed.[^439]

”Moldova is the only country in the EU’s neighbourhood that applied a
two-months state of emergency (18 March-15 May) rather than worldwide
spread one-month period, followed by various extensions. Consequently,
legal restrictions on public gatherings larger than three people arose,
while the work of civil servants, including the private and
non-governmental sectors, have entered “home-office” mode. The public
consultations in the decision-making at the level of local public
administration faced serious challenges. Even the central institutions
did not use or had set up enough online platforms.”[^440]

The Republic of Moldova did not have a coherent communication strategy
concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, while many senior officials in
Chisinau continue ignoring minimum precautions. Moreover, public
authorities failed to combat disinformation campaigns and fake news
launched by representatives of the Moldovan Orthodox Church, and many
obscure websites continued to promote conspiracy theories, although at
the beginning of the pandemic the Intelligence and Security Service in
Chisinau blocked over fifty such websites. However, numerous such
websites continue to spread fake news, and no further actions have been
taken.[^441]

**Norway**

In the beginning of the pandemic in Norway, most major platforms (such
as NRK.no, Aftenposten.no, DN.no VG.no, etc.) had a permanent banner on
top of their website with a direct link to official Covid-19
information. This permanently visible link has now been removed from the
mentioned pages, but the information pages remain active.[^442]

Major news platforms are still central to the government’s communication
strategy. Regular and ad hoc press conferences are held by government
and health officials to communicate information about measures taken to
prevent the spreading of the virus and to inform the population about
applicable restrictions and recommendations. Participants include all
major national and regional news platforms, such as NRK, VG, Dagbladet,
Aftenposten, Bergens Tidende (biggest newspaper in Bergen),
Fædrelandsvennen (biggest newspaper for the area around Kristiansand in
southern Norway), etc. Typically, the platform will include links to
official information pages in their coverage, but the press releases
also includes posters and graphics and other material depicting the
latest measures.

Official platforms for information include:

- Regjeringen (regjeringen.no)[^443]

- Folkehelseinstituttet (fhi.no)[^444]\
- Helsedirektoratet (helsedirektoratet.no)[^445]\
- Helsenorge (helsenorge.no)[^446]

Several of the news media also have dedicated pages following the
pandemic nationally and internationally, for example
Aftenposten.no[^447] and NRK.no.[^448]

Most public institutions also have a dedicated page for Covid-19
information, i.e.:

- University of Oslo (UiO) and other educational institutions[^449]\
**-** NAV (the Norwegian authority for social services)[^450]

- Vy[^451] (national train service)\
- Ruter.no[^452] (tram and bus service in Oslo)\
- Medietilsynet (the Norwegian Media Authority)[^453]

**Portugal (a)**

Yes. The Ministry of Health has created a webpage dedicated to Covid-19
with hyperlinks to released on YouTube.[^454] Moreover, the Government
strongly recommends the use of the "StayAway Covid" app which is
available on App Store and Google Play

**Portugal (b)**

Yes. Each Ministry and Service has created a website called Covid-19.
Informative. STAYAWAY Covid Mobile Application was created.[^455]

**Serbia**

The most significant platform is established by the Ministry of Health
of the Republic of Serbia and Institute of Public Health of Serbia “Dr.
Milan Jovanovic Batut”[^456] as well as Chatbot for the Government of
the Republic of Serbia - Viber Automatic Covid-19 Chatbot
Serbia.[^457]In cooperation with Rakuten Viber, the Government of the
Republic of Serbia launched an automatic Covid19 chatbot info service on
the Viber platform, in order to provide citizens with verified
information, important news and answers to questions regarding Covid-19.
The info service contains medical info on the virus, real-time data,
prevention measures and guidelines, important numbers and government
decisions related to the state of emergency and relaxation of measures.
Furthermore, via Viber, by using a number 064/88 11 405, citizens can
report non-compliance with epidemiological measures, especially in
catering facilities and other places where a large number of citizens
gather.[^458] This Chatbot is also established by the Ministry of Health
of the Republic of Serbia.

**South Africa**

Yes. In particular, the Electronic Communications, Postal and
Broadcasting Directions issued under the Disaster Management Act require
all websites with a top level .za top level domain name to have a
visible link on their home pages to the government coronavirus
information website (www.sacoronavirus.co.za). It is difficult to
estimate compliance but it appears to be high among large organisations,
which also have websites that receive most traffic. Thus, it would
appear that the measure has been effective in making the link visible
and the information available. Also, in terms of the Amendment of
Information and Communications Technology ("ICT") Covid-19 National
Disaster Regulations, "\[a\]ll Electronic Communications Service and
Electronic Communications Network Service licensees must zero rate all
Covid-19 sites upon approval by the department of health".

**Spain**

Yes, public institutions rely upon their social accounts to reach out
different audiences and disseminate Covid-19 instructions. Institutional
messages are channeled through Twitter, Facebook, YouTube or Instagram,
to name a few.[^459] Moreover, regional authorities are largely involved
in such strategy given the fact that public health powers are assigned
to such entities and thus they are also intensively using social
accounts.[^460]

Given the challenges caused by the pandemic, social platforms and health
authorities also agreed to prioritize certain messages related to
measures and recommendations connected to Covid-19[^461]. Twitter, for
instance, displays a message (i.e. “Know the facts”) and a direct to
link to the Health Ministry when the word “coronavirus” is
searched[^462].

\
Question 10: Has the role of platforms in dealing with Covid-19-related discourses/disinformation impacted the way these platforms are considered in your country? 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: We are not asking you for an empirical study, but rather a
qualitative assessment. Perhaps you can provide some examples of
articles or research papers dealing with these issues.

### Albania

### There has been no research conducted so far covering this matter. The Audio-Visual Media Authority, has not published report on how fake news has changed the way these platforms are considered among the population. 

**Argentina**

Not at all. For example several issues were found in the "CuidAr"
app.[^463]

**Belgium**

As regards whether the role of platforms in dealing with
Covid-19-related discourses/disinformation has impacted the way these
platforms are considered in Belgium, some of the findings of a study
conducted by the University of Antwerp (Belgium) in collaboration with
the University of Zürich (Switzerland) can be mentioned[^464]. In
particular, it concerns survey results concerning the perceptions of
disinformation, media coverage and government policy related to the
coronavirus in six Western countries (Belgium (Flanders), Germany,
France, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States):

-   In Flanders, almost seven out of ten people (who are active on
    social media) are worried about these kinds of messages. Just over
    half of the respondents indicated that they saw or read (very) often
    false or misleading information. Another 40% find it rather
    exceptional, and only a few (according to their own words) never
    come into contact with it (p. 2);

-   When shown a manipulated social media post regarding Covid-19 with a
    statement saying that the virus is a possible bioweapon from China,
    ‘only’ 16-18% of the Flemish respondents indicated to be willing to
    engage with it, by means of a like, share or comment (pp. 5-6).

However, it does not appear (for now) that this study, though it has
been reported on by the media[^465], nor any other available information
concerning the presence, on platforms, of Covid-19-related
disinformation has impacted public opinion regarding the role of
platforms or triggered any political action in that respect. There is
another study with 1.679 respondents that has found that news consumers
in Flanders trust traditional media more than social media in relation
to information about the coronavirus, and that they think that fake news
about the virus is mostly spread by social media (esp. Facebook).[^466]

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

There has been some general discussion on the impact of online
platforms, especially social media on the Covid-19- related discourse
and (dis)information sharing. For example, the most prominent
fact-checker sites in the country, as well as the region, have qualified
social media platforms as polygons or “playgrounds” for disseminating
disinformation about the pandemic.[^467] The Special Report about the
Dissemination on the Coronavirus published by the European External
Action Service (EEAS), notes several issues related to the coverage of
the pandemic in the Western Balkans region. False news, misinformation
and disinformation concerning Covid-19 were observed in the WB
information environment. [^468]

However, there has been no discussion at the level of state policy on
whether online platform need to be regulated or considered in a
different way. The general discussion about BiH needing a new set of
media-related laws, including those that would regulate the internet,
remains prevalent during the pandemic. More focus is placed on the
responsibility of platforms that should, by self-regulation, steer the
course of information sharing online.[^469] Also, as in other countries,
the focus is usually on specific instances of moderation
decisions,[^470] a small number of them, and a wider or a more
systematic reconsideration of the role of platforms is lacking.

**Croatia**

Facebook has a reputation of allowing "just anything" so not a very
trustworthy source of information. The government issued a warning about
fake news to the public.[^471]

### Cyprus

There has not been a wide discussion about this issue.

**\
**

**Denmark**

Not only in relation to Covid-19, but more in general on free speech on
online platforms.[^472] A new inter-ministerial task force consisting of
heads of the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the
Ministry of Justice, PET and FE, who will coordinate the response to
major misinformation attempts in recognition of threats across
areas.[^473]

We believe there is generally a growing attention that online platforms
are used to spread disinformation, but there are simultaneously
struggles to dealing with it, for example without limiting basic human
rights.

**Estonia**

The reputation of the platforms does not appear to have changed during
the “Covid-era”. It seems more likely that the pre-existing reputation
has been re-enforced as the same patterns of bias have exhibited
themselves.

**Finland**

There is ongoing research, but not yet published results 

**Germany**

While their role in dealing with Covid-19 discourses has been
debated,[^474] on a broad, societal level Covid-19 and the related
disinformation has not substantially reframed the ongoing general
discussion about the platforms, at least not beyond the threshold of
triggering nationwide attention or political action. The fact that
planned changes to the NetzDG drafted pre-Covid were not modified in
light of the pandemic and its communicative side effects points in that
direction, too. While individual moderation decisions by platforms
against politicians or other public figures (most notably Donald Trump)
are heavily reported on,[^475] questions regarding shifting practices or
roles of these platforms remain in the background.

**Israel**

Covid-19 arrived after the Israeli public's trust in online platforms
decreased significantly in the last two years.[^476]  

One interesting Israel-specific impact is the role of online platforms
among the Haredi (Jewish ultra orthodox) population. This population
avoids the internet (and classic media) for religious reasons. For a
variety of reasons including their avoidance of media and internet and
also being a poor population, the Haredi population was the hardest hit
by covid-19 in Israel. As a result, the demand for internet connection
and social media among the Jewish orthodox community has raised
significantly. 

**Italy**

We don't have examples of that. It seems that the disinformation did not
impact the role and position of the most popular platforms.

**Latvia**

Covid-19 and the related disinformation has not substantially reframed
the ongoing general discussion about the platforms, at least not beyond
the threshold of triggering nationwide attention or political action.
The only debates there have been on the liability for the distribution
of fake news; however, such liability would apply mostly to the
distributor himself (both as a private person and media), not the
platforms.[^477] It can be noted, however, that the believers of
alternative theories are now feeling like YouTube and Facebook
censors[^478] them, thus they have made Telegram channels[^479] and
presumably also chats (which are seen as "safer").

However, the "infodemics" has actualised the discussion on the need to
provide clear legal definitions of "disinformation" and the liability
for its distribution.[^480] Even though during the debate in May it was
stated that these news to not resonate widely and are mostly distributed
within specific limited circles, thus might not be so dangerous, the
State police noted that "there is a need for an effective tool for the
social network, internet and television operators to delete false
messages, as they do not always do so at the request of the
police."[^481] As the possible options, there have been considered
amendments on The Law on the Press and Other Media, the Law on
Electronic Media and the creation of a new framework to include websites
that are not subject to the two laws mentioned above. Also, it has been
recognised as necessary to assess the inclusion of a new norm in the
Criminal Law, which would be aimed at prohibiting deliberate
dissemination of false, misleading, distorted information.

### Lithuania

Not to our knowledge.

**Moldova**

I have not found exact data in this regard. Still, some improved
perceptions about Facebook could be grasped based on the fact that to
provide support and assistance for vulnerable social categories affected
by the pandemic, special groups[^482];[^483] were created, for example:
“List of the most useful groups on Facebook in Moldova XIX: communities
that appeared in the context of COVID-19”; ” List of the most useful
groups on Facebook in Moldova XX: communities that help each other in
the context of COVID-19”; “We support local business in Moldova” et al.

**Norway**

There do not seem to be any significant changes in the way the main
platforms are considered in Norway. However, without being able to show
statistics, the digital platforms of relevant governmental authorities
(i.e. the health authorities) are likely to have substantially increased
their visitors in the last 7,5 months. As such, it has perhaps become a
trend to cross-check information with these platforms and ensure that
numbers and statistics are gathered from the actual source, and not just
through mainstream media channels.

For example, when reading a ‘click-bait’ title about Covid-19, such as
’covid-deaths on the increase’, it seems people have become more likely
to refer to FHI (the public health authority) to check the correct
numbers and information. This in contrast to before Covid-19, when most
people would not have considered checking the health authorities’
platforms for correct information on health-related news.

### Portugal (a)

Instagram is credited for giving users very interesting options to deal
with the Covid-19 pandemics rather than just providing accurate
information or fake news.[^484]

### Portugal (b)

Yes, these platforms have been very popular with all sectors of society
and with an impact on citizenship and information for the
population.[^485]

**Serbia**

Public discussion on Covid-19-related discourses and disinformation is
vivid, particularly on the platforms. However, platforms' role in
dealing with Covid-19-related discourses/disinformation has not changed
their public perception considerably. Studies considering their
influence during the pandemic are rare. This is a topic yet to be
analyzed.[^486]

**South Africa**

Social media has contained large amounts of misinformation, which is
occasionally addressed by other users of the social media. We are not
aware that this has led to particular animosity towards, or distrust of,
the platforms themselves, rather than the people who have shared the
misinformation. There does seem to be an awareness that people should
verify information they receive on Covid or the lockdown, but this is
not limited to social media. Recent calls for better regulation of
WhatsApp suggest a growing realisation that the sharing of unverified
information poses a health risk. However, it is noteworthy that the
calls focus on the duties of private users of WhatsApp rather than
WhatsApp itself or the government.[^487]

**Spain**

We have found some debate about the Spanish case. 68% of Spanish
internet users expressed concern about whether Internet-based
information is real or not. Having in mind that these data belong to the
*Study of the digital situation, internet and social networks. Spain,
January 2020,*[^488], we can deduce that trust in platforms from which
Spanish users extract that information / disinformation is also
questioned. According to Casero-Ripollés, the data suggest that more
consumption of news about the Coronavirus did not translate into a
significant increase in trust towards the media.[^489]

However, López Rico[^490] *et al.* conclude that respondents have valued
the information about the coronavirus provided by the media as truthful,
showing a clear pattern of co-occurrence in two groups: the media with a
center-left editorial line and those of the center-right.

In the interviews carried out with the responsible for Spanish
fact-checking companies, it is mentioned that YouTube was singled out
for not carrying out verification efforts at all. The platform started
then implementing measures to verify its contents.[^491]

Question 11: Can you provide input for our conclusions summing up your impression of whether platforms in your country have dealt with the issue sensibly or not and what the key challenges are from your perspective.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Albania

### Yes, the platforms in the country have dealt relatively well and professionally in the coverage of the virus period and have tried to avoid fake news. It can be assumed that one of the problems related to platforms, could be the lack of experience or lack of staff to deal with and focus on specific cases. Usually fake news in this country are more heightened and become part of the political fight among the main political parties. 

### In Albania the platforms cited above are widely used mainly among the younger generations. The time spent on them is quite high and consequently, the information reflected there affects the way these group of people also perceives the situation, creating often misunderstandings with regards to measures which need to be taken. In most cases, the Prime Minister has used Facebook to spread the information on the measures taken/introduced as well as the progress of the situation. This has often caused dissatisfaction due to the expectations of the public to receive information only through official channels through visual or print media. 

### The main challenge that arises is especially related to ensuring the authenticity of information provided through social networks, avoiding offensive or discriminatory comments by the public and raising awareness at the national level about the importance of using online platforms. 

**Argentina**

In my view, although an attempt has been made to treat the information
seriously in general, political party interests, for electoral purposes,
have played a distorting role of reality. The challenge lies in
decontaminating the information of these intentions.

**Belgium**

Importantly, the online platforms, that is to say Facebook and Twitter,
in Belgium are enhancing the reach of trusted sources. In particular,
they increase the visibility of official government information, by
promoting their official websites, messages and pages.

In addition, they take measures to trace and take down Covid-19-related
disinformation. However, it appears from information disseminated by the
federal police unit searching for (Covid-19-related) disinformation that
online platforms remove only half of the posts which it reported to them
as being problematic (237/450, see *supra* no. 5). It seems as though
this could be problematic. Accordingly, there might be room for
improvement as regards the cooperation and joint action against
disinformation between and by online platforms and the Belgian
authorities.

As it appears from the study conducted by the University of Antwerp and
the University of Zürich concerning the perceptions of disinformation,
media coverage and government policy related to the coronavirus in six
Western countries cited above (see *supra* no. 10) that 7 out of 10
active users are worried about Covid-19-related disinformation, it is
clear that online platforms can and should still do more.

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

I would say that the pandemic has brought a more active engagement in
content moderation by the platforms, especially on a global level.
Before the pandemic, in a way, it was unimaginable for platforms to
exercises this level of content moderation, including flagging of posts
as false or inaccurate and banning the profiles of groups or
individuals. In a sense, I would say that content moderation relating to
Covid-19 disinformation had a sort of a spill-over effect or speeded the
decisions of content moderation relating of other topics, such as the
recent initiative by Facebook to better regulate hate speech and enhance
the accessibility of credible sources about the Holocaust.[^492]

In a local context, there is not enough academic discussion and research
on the topic, and I have not been able to detect any kind of systemic
overview on how platforms have tried to deal with the Covid-19 related
disinformation, except for intensifying awareness raising and media
literacy campaigns, usually in co-operation with civil society, media
outlets, fack checker platforms, and international organisations active
in the field of freedom of expression and others such as WHO.

On a more general note, I would say that the perception of the wider
public with regards to how platforms have dealt with the issue became
more negative as the infodemic reached its peak in the midst of the
lockdown. In a sense, the level of trust in information shared on the
platforms kept decreasing, which was backed up by a general feeling of
information overload and fatigue.

**Croatia**

In comparison to public media the platforms of social media were often
used to disseminate false information. In particular, they provided
space for world known Croatian scientists who managed to keep the trust
of the majority population.

### Cyprus

At European institutional level it is obvious that there have been
adopted quite satisfactory measures towards this issue. For example, we
can mention the EU Code of conduct on countering illegal hate speech
online which has been agreed in May 2016 between European Commission and
online platforms, such as Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube in
order to prevent and counter the spread of illegal hate speech
online.[^493] We can also mention the Code of Practice on Disinformation
which is the first worldwide self-regulatory set of standards to fight
disinformation voluntarily signed by platforms, leading social networks,
advertisers and advertising industry in October 2018. Signatories are
Facebook, Twitter, Mozilla, Google and associations and members of the
advertising industry. Microsoft subscribed to the Code of Practice in
May 2019. TikTok joined the code in June 2020.[^494] This Code is part
of a number of measures and policies taken from EU in order to tackle
disinformation and assure a safe online environment.

Despite the well-structured European policy, we can remark a special
lack of organized state policy. For example, the fact that there is not
a special law on social media or in the field of online disinformation
raise great interest. Moreover, a large number of Cypriots citizens
believe that public authorities should adopt special measures in order
to help them better identify disinformation, prevent those who spread
disinformation from abusing social media platform services and regulate
social media platforms to reduce the distribution of fake news (special
eurobarometer 503) . From that point of view, the scientific observation
of the aforementioned issues is quite interesting and provocative and
will lead to several conclusions, such as the quality of the rights of
online users, their online consciousness and the right balance between
national and private policies regarding the fighting against the
pandemic of Covid.

**Denmark**

There is already an issue of dealing with freedom of expression on
online platforms, and Covid-19 has only increased this pressure. Speech
can hurt, and it can have consequences. I fear - and this is my personal
opinion - that we are already seeing basic freedom rights being
suspended on online platforms, and disinformation is now a gateway for
more content moderation. There is an inherent problem in our conception
of verifiable information. What is true and what should be followed
changes rapidly, especially in the pandemic. This means that verifiable
sources such as governmental communications might contradict. To give an
example: the Danish Health Authorities changed their viewpoint on the
effect of masks (first they did not see them as useful, and now they
enforce the use of masks in all public spaces). Does it mean that a
social media post saying that masks are helpful before the public
authorities the authorities defined it obligatory, is considered
disinformation? What about the post saying masks are not helpful after
the public authorities said it is? There seems to be a temporal aspect
that needs to be considered in the definition of what is
disinformation. 

**Estonia**

The platforms have enabled public discussion about the issue and have
not suppressed contradictory or conflicting views. The approach of the
major platforms does not appear different from approaches towards other
issues which affect the well-being on the entire nation. The key
challenge is perhaps to explain to the population the statistical
figures – what does exactly mean the coefficient of infections per 100
000 etc. There is one feature which characterizes all platforms in
dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic: the tone of humor is entirely
missing from any news dissemination, public discussions or editorials.
It is perhaps leading to a perspective of double vulnerability:
epistemic vulnerability of anyone using the internet, which is magnified
by vulnerability of everyone in front of the new pandemic.

**Finland**

Finland has strong confidence on authorities, media and medical science.
For example vaccine coverage is very high in Finland. One of the
examples is the wide scale adoption of the Koronavilkku app (showing
warning of covid19 contagion), over 4 million have uploaded the app to
their phone. Most of the disinformation is coming from abroad and
traditional measures have been sufficient.

**Germany**

It seems platforms have done well in contextualizing disinformation and
enhancing the reach of trusted sources. Regarding content moderation the
dimensions and impacts of the changes in rules and enforcement methods
are still unclear. In that regard, more transparency and research is
necessary. Overall, it seems platforms escape a new wave of demands to
become “arbiters of truth” in Germany due to the relative consensus on
scientific findings and methods among the democratic parties. For this
reason, Covid-19 related platform actions that derive their legitimacy
from this consensus are – by and large – uncontroversial, if not
welcome.

**Israel**

No input here at this time. There does not seem to be any serious effort
by the platforms.

**Italy**

Our impression is that Facebook and Twitter made an effort to show that
they are taking the problem seriously by removing contents on ground of
its inaccuracy. We don't have neither the impression nor information to
say that this was a country-specific strategy, but a more general
approach which relies also to external fact-checking platforms. In Italy
the Government insists more on the awareness of individual citizens than
on what platforms can do. We think that those are not mutually exclusive
strategies: the key challenge is to combat disinformation while also
improving individuals' awareness and knowledge of the social media
world.

**Latvia**

The main challenge, of course, is balancing between the restrictions of
false news and the freedom of expression. It can be seen that Facebook
has become an accessible playground for various fake-news distributors,
also regarding the need to fight against masks and vaccines. Such
Facebook functions as Groups are beneficial for these purposes. However,
in our opinion, Facebook has acted sensibly. There is constant
fact-checking and the people impacted by that also point to that;
however, this does not take place in such amounts that they would search
for a more concealed platform. Additionally, useful for both sides is
the fact that the fact-checkers cannot and do not delete any posts, just
"mark" them as false.[^495] Especially beneficial is the rebuking of
fake news in specific articles on the webpages of fact-checkers, thus
allowing the people to understand why the information has been marked
and what do the other sources say.

The media is continuously publishing articles on the cases when YouTube
and other actors have deleted the videos and other media containing fake
news.[^496] At the same time, more transparency and clarity is needed on
how the articles get marked as fake, when and how they get sent to the
fact-checkers, what funds they receive from Facebook etc. Additionally,
more clarity is needed on how other platforms – Telegram, WhatsApp,
YouTube – are currently fighting against fake news and what is their
strategy regarding the deletion of posts. Additionally, in our
perspective, even more emphasis should be put on the official news
regarding the pandemic, i.e., Facebook should be even more proactive in
their distribution.

### Lithuania

Sufficient information was provided on official websites of the
Government institutions.\
The positive role of mainstream news providers in identifying fake news
related to Covid-19 was noticeable. Facebook users in Lithuania received
some information on where to turn to for official information regarding
Covid-19.

**Moldova**

Key challenge (A):

”As for the large-scale data hacks, Russia has a twelve-year history of
cyberattacks against the EU’s associated states. In 2008 Georgia faced a
large-scale cyberattack coinciding with Russia’s military intervention.
Since then cyberattacks continue against government websites, media,
private sector, energy companies and election commissions in Georgia,
Moldova and Ukraine.”[^497]

Key challenge (B):

Transnistrian separatist region within the Republic of Moldova:
violations of freedom of expression and protection of personal data. As
the following source, Asociația Promo-LEX, National Endowment for
Democracy, suggests:

”In parallel with the adoption of comprehensive declarations or
guidelines by international human rights organizations, the
administration of the Transnistrian region is adopting its own acts. On
March 17, 2020, the alleged security ministry in Tiraspol issued a
statement stating that in the Transnistrian region there were cases of
using messenger chats and social media groups that shared information
that did not correspond to the truth. In this regard, the inhabitants of
the region were advised to be careful about what information they
distribute, and if in doubt, that information can be verified with the
"central authorities". It should be noted that this communiqué comes
with the establishment of the state of emergency and the application of
restrictive measures that have been the subject of discussions in the
public space in the region. Meanwhile, the alleged interior ministry in
Tiraspol says that people who break the quarantine rules are identified
with the help of surveillance cameras and the facial recognition system.

In addition, on April 21, 2020, the Tiraspol Operational Commission, set
up to manage the epidemiological crisis, ordered the verification of all
online information (including messenger chats) that describes or
mentions the insufficient provision of medical personnel in the
Transnistrian region with means of protection.

(...) In the last two years, the administration of the Transnistrian
region has adopted a restrictive and sufficiently consistent policy
against the opposition, civil society organizations or simply against
uncomfortable people. Thus, in the spring of 2018, the control over the
associative environment was formalized, and in the spring of 2019, the
local Criminal Code was amended in the sense of restricting the freedom
of expression. Given this context, the acts issued by the de facto
administration in Tiraspol in March and April 2020 only provide
continuity to the policy of restricting the space of civil society and
freedom of expression in the Transnistrian region. As a result of this
situation, but also of other serious cases, on May 4, 2020, the
Promo-LEX Association urged the representatives of the 5 + 2 negotiation
format to take all possible measures not to admit the violation of
freedom of expression in the Transnistrian region. Thus, the "Not Free"
rating given by Freedom House to the Transnistrian region is as truthful
and well-founded as possible.” (author’s own translation from
Romanian).[^498]

**Norway**

The news- and official platforms in Norway have dealt sensibly with the
issue of Covid-19 disinformation. There has been a lot of attention
towards disinformation, and most platforms have published articles about
the risk of disinformation about the pandemic.[^499]

In terms of social media platforms and disinformation about Covid-19,
there is little information about how this has been handled. Most
information found in Norwegian sources points to information posted on
Facebook by people abroad, i.e. the chain letter from the Italian
doctor.[^500]

### Portugal (a)

In Portugal platforms deal with the issue mainly echoing policies
adopted in their country of origin. Portuguese is not yet a working
language for most fact-checking bots and basically platforms do not
follow a Portugal-specific approach, but rather see it as a limited part
of the European single market.

The news feed of platforms in Portugal on Covi-19mirrors to a large
extent what happens in their country of origin, nowadays focused in the
US presidential elections. A first challenge is therefore to have a
wider perspective, and in particular a more European focused approach.

Then, it would be important to have a real-time and more effective
system of fact-checking on Covid-19 news, probably using colours to
inform the public about the accuracy of information (green for OK,
yellow for unchecked, red for confirmed "fake-news"). Moreover, it would
be important to identifiy clearly whether a text is presented as factual
information or merely an opinion or even a fiction, not to mention that
sponsored messages should clearly identify their nature as well as the
sponsor.

Freedom of expression is to be guaranteed, but so does the right of the
public not to be misled or manipulated in a democratic and open society.

### Portugal (b)

In the present and in the field of Human Rights, an analysis and
interpretation of the impact of digital platforms on people's
well-being, their quality of life and how they should act to prevent
problems of the mental and psychic health forum is important. Question
how human rights are integrated in these Digital Platforms. Realizing
what interests they are serving

**Serbia**

As said before, Serbia has been identified as one of the several
countries with the most substantial impact of fake news. The situation
has worsened during the pandemic. Much of the Covid-19-related
disinformation has come from the platforms listed above, particularly
from Facebook. While some criminal investigations for causing panic and
fear by fake news dissemination through social media have been
initiated, no one has yet been sentenced. The serious problem is that
the official Covid-19-related data are disputed by investigative
journalists and medical experts not engaged in their collection and
processing. Improving the official Covid19-related information system
would limit the space for spreading disinformation through platforms.

**South Africa**

We have not found evidence that the South African social media groups
are themselves monitoring their platforms through structural mechanisms
such as fact-checkers. Instead, misinformation is tackled through
individual complaints from the public, and corrected not by the platform
but by third parties who choose to engage with the misinformation. These
include private individuals and organisations such as Real411, the
Centre for Analytics and Behavioural Change (CABC), Africa Check and AFP
(itself an organisation based in France). The key challenges that the
media platforms need to meet is therefore to ensure that there are
sufficient fact-checkers monitoring their news feeds. The government
should consider measures to monitor and enforce compliance with its
Regulation requiring media sites to remove false information.[^501]

**Spain**

Lots of research must be done in relation with content moderation. Our
Law on Information Society Services does not help. There is a need for
change in legislation and in this regard the Regulation (EU) 2019/1150
of the European Parliament and the Council of June 20, 2019 about equity
and transparency for users of intermediation services is a good
initiative.

Since several actors participate in the diffusion of illegal material
online, the responsibility of a safe Internet should be shared among all
these players. Concrete regulatory improvements may encourage online
hosting platforms to do their part in monitoring proactively and
diligently, such as affirming a good Samaritan clause.

The self-regulation of platforms has not been enough to get good
results.

\
Question 12: Can you provide input for our recommendations regarding the question of how different stakeholders – a) state authorities, b) companies/platforms, c) civil society – should act in the future to more effectively fight Covid-19-related disinformation. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Albania

State authorities should act in a transparent manner, communicate
accurately, and characterized by seriousness and with full
responsibility.

Companies/platforms should focus more on checking their stories, news
and prevent fake news. That would mean more money used at a time of
difficulties. Nonetheless, it needs more attention, willingness from
them to fight such a phenomenon, but also a stronger culture of fighting
disinformation.

### Argentina

Public authorities must adhere as strictly as possible to the
recommendations of the world health organization and dispense with
electoral struggle in decision-making. In addition, they must develop
more efficient and secure applications and less invasive of privacy,
since numerous questions have been made to them. For their part, private
companies and platforms must concentrate all their efforts to achieve
the elimination of clearly false information without affecting freedom
of expression and information. They must also continue to provide
applications and sites where false news can be dismantled and access to
reliable and updated information. Finally, civil society is responsible
for monitoring these efforts and coordinating its own with public
authorities and private companies to achieve better results in the fight
against false information related to the pandemic and to help in the
ways possible to people affected by the pandemic.

**Belgium**

State authorities: Belgian authorities could invest in raising awareness
among citizens (through campaigns) about the negative impact and
consequences of Covid-19-related disinformation on society (e.g.: that
it endangers public health, directly affecting people’s lives). Next to
that state authorities can, since private actors are the ones running
the online platforms where disinformation campaigns are being launched
and spread, provide incentives to private actors so they would
prioritize the truth over profit margins, a logical prerequisite for
effectively participating in anti-disinformation actions. The role of
the public service broadcasters in promoting accurate information and
the role of other traditional media (newspapers, broadcasters) is also
of importance.

Companies/platforms: Online platforms should permanently keep on
searching and removing fake news, including through extensive content
moderation workforces. Additionally, they should enhance cooperation and
joint action against disinformation between and by them and the Belgian
authorities. Providing feedback about whether or not and why certain
posts are removed and others not is also important.

Civil society: Civil society organization could organize media literacy
workshops, develop fact checking networks, promote the use of legacy
media, report disinformation, ...

### Bosnia and Herzegovina

a\) State authorities should acknowledge companies/platforms and civil
society as partners in their efforts to correctly balance between the
need to protect the health and freedom of expression of citizens, in
connection to fighting disinformation and that could have real life and
harmful implications. State authorities should also make sure to
communicate all information related to the pandemic in a transparent,
accurate, timely and responsible manner, including through platforms.

b\) With regards to relation with state authorities, companies and
platforms should be more transparent about their content management
protocols, and co-operate more openly with countries, and possibly
consider co-regulation on a country-by-country basis (possibly by
appointing a Focal Point for each country). Also, with regards to civil
society, they should engage more in programs to empower users to be able
to better distinguish between information that comes from credible
sources and disinformation shared by unverified sources.

c\) Civil society organizations and platforms that operate as fact
checkers should remain performing their role as watchdogs, and advocate
more actively towards state authorities for adoption of a more
up-to-date legal framework that would regulate this field.

**Croatia**

If the information by the authorities is provided timely and accurately
with verifiable sources it narrows the play field for fake news. 

### Cyprus

a\) State authorities should adopt specific measures towards the
regulation of social media. In general, there is a lack of
well-structured legislation on internet issues.

b\) Companies and platforms should play a decisive role in the meaning
that they have to []{#_Hlk57377500 .anchor}support fact-checking
services, promote self-regulation (such as codes of conduct) and develop
satisfactory mechanisms in order to identify fake news and prevent those
who spread disinformation. \
\
c) Civil society should be more sensitive about the rights and the
obligations on the internet. Living on a digital era presumes that
online users are well educated and use internet services for the common
good. it is obvious that educational seminars and the participation of
both public and private authorities are of primary value.

**Denmark**

Just a personal reflection: we should be aware that when controlling
disinformation, we risk harming fundamental rights as freedom of
expression. And where the virus hopefully is only a period of time (even
several years) the harm done to fundamental rights, rights who people
fought for decades, can have far greater consequences.

**\
**

**Estonia**

a\) state authorities should keep on publishing on daily basis official
statistical information, which will then be disseminated by social media
platforms. State authorities should emphasize the importance of
scientific approach to Covid-19, which by implication is countering
disinformation.

b\) companies/platforms should maintain their regular standards in fight
against misinformation. It might be considered whether assigning special
moderators to articles dealing with Covid-19 is justified to strengthen
the countering of misinformation.

c\) civil society should hold high the principle of access to information
and freedom of expression.

**Finland**

Finland has done good pilot on involving social media influencers and
sending them facts on corona. This has been very efficient way to combat
misinformation that comes through social media channels.

**Germany**

a\) State authorities should ensure that public information shared on
platforms only relates to essential public health issues. The
acquiescence of companies to be a magnifier for governmental information
should not be misused.

b\) Platforms should more transparently communicate the extent in which
decisions to (not) delete content regarding presumed Covid-19
disinformation are made in order to facilitate human rights assessments.

c\) Civil society should hold both state authorities and platforms
accountable for balancing health and free speech interests and become
involved in ensuring legitimacy and accountability in reigning in
Covid-19 related disinformation.

**Israel**

All actors need to be more transparent. The government in Israel feared
transparency since the policy changed so frequently and sometimes in an
erratic way. Platforms should also be transparent and clear as to how
they treat reports of misleading info. It is hard to define "truth" and
"fake", but there is info where such designation is possible (for
example attribution of info to official sources when it is or is not)

**Italy**

We think that state authorities and civil society should focus on
improving awareness and knowledge of the mechanism of online
information. Platforms and companies should address the issue of
external transparency as well as that of protection of those users who
are more exposed to disinformation.

**Latvia**

a\) State authorities should continue their active presence in the social
media, thus providing legitimate information as a way of fighting
disinformation. In such a way, also the closeness between the
leaders/decision-makers and the people is ensured.

b\) Platforms should be more transparent on how the decisions on the
modification of content are taken, i.e., when the post is reviewed by
content moderators and when by the fact-checkers. Sudden deletions of
posts give ground for the publishers to state they "have been censored".
Additionally, the platforms should prioritise the official
health-connected statements posted in the networks by the ministries and
other state actors. A good initiative would be sending the users
notifications as soon as such statements have been published.

c\) The members of civil society which help Facebook in its fact check
should be open about it. Other representatives should hold both state
authorities and platforms accountable of balancing health and free
speech interests.

### Lithuania

a\) Official information should be widely available. It should be timely,
objective, and consistent. If new data lead to a change in an assessment
of the situation, this should be indicated and explained (e.g.,
regarding the effectiveness of face masks). International co-operation
should ensure that information is shared, in particular regarding the
new research-based data on the virus and regarding the restrictive
measures applied in other states. Specific efforts may be required to
inform citizens who are abroad on the possibilities of returning to a
home country (e.g. using services of mobile operators, call centers).
Particular information and communication needs in the society should be
identified based on surveys and other methods of sociological research.

b\) Companies and platforms should take a socially responsible attitude
and provide information to the users on where to find official
information and how to make your own assessment on whether information
published on the Internet is reliable. If fake news had been identified,
this should be indicated to the public. Artificial intelligence-based
solutions should be explored as a helpful tool to identify
disinformation.

c\) Remaining passive when faced with disinformation or knowingly
contributing to disinformation should not be seen as normal. Civil
society organizations can help identify disinformation and debunk it.
They can also raise awareness of where to find official information and
how to assess the reliability of information.

**Moldova**

The support of the EU in improving **the cyber resilience** of the R.
Moldova. Something is being done in this regard, as the following source
suggests: “On 8 April 2020 the EU published a comprehensive paper on how
it is responding to the Coronavirus in the world. This includes
announcements on mobilizing funds for its neighbours, with €962 million
for the EaP states, and €700 million for the Western Balkans. This also
includes reinforcing the fight against disinformation, naming the
Russian sources of information disorders. This is particularly important
for the EU’s neighbours who are often in need of the EU’s support to
condemn the pro-Kremlin origins of the information warfare against them.
Overall, the outbreak of Coronavirus once more highlighted that the EU
should systematically fight against disinformation, and assure access to
critical information and freedom of expression in its neighbourhood
post-2020.”[^502]

The Resolution of the 2020 Media Forum of the Republic of Moldova
*(Chișinău, 24-25 November 2020)* contains some specific recommendations
for the Republic of Moldova, although it does not refer explicitly to
online platforms[^503].

### Norway

a\) State authorities should continue to provide the most up-to-date
information about the status of Covid-19. Perhaps there could be
increased transparency in relation to the purchasing agreements we have
made in relation to vaccines, how they are tested and when we will get
these. A lot of the disinformation in the media relates to vaccines, big
pharma, and alternative treatment, which could be eliminate by improved
transparency from the public health authorities and the government.

b\) Companies/platforms should be more transparent in relation to fact
checking and removing information about Covid-19. It was difficult to
find information about how the platforms are dealing with
disinformation, and to what extent this has been a problem. Increased
transparency around this could be useful. Also, the highlighting or
marking of disinformation is preferrable to its removal. This would
mitigate the potential problem of censorship by platforms, which would
otherwise be a risk in situations where it is difficult to identify
disinformation due to a general lack of knowledge (such as at the start
of the pandemic). People would still have access to the information,
including the disclaimer that the information is
false/unreliable/misleading, which may help prevent the continued
spreading of the disinformation through other channels as well as
conspiracy theories and the like.

c\) Civil society could continue to contribute to a diverse debate on
Covid-19 and disinformation. Furthermore, people should be more critical
of their sources and take care to double-check information before
passing it on or sharing it on social media. The more sensational the
information, the more thorough the fact check ought to be. It would also
be helpful if people sought essential information from alternative
sources to avoid the echo-chamber effect caused by social media
algorithms.

### Portugal (a)

State authorities enact and enforce media regulations.
Companies/platforms acting as media should comply with such regulations
and adopt self-regulation codes of ethics, the implementation of which
should not be left only to bots. The implementation of info-ethics and
media regulations by algorithms should be transparent and open to civil
society movements and organizations. The answer to the machine is not
only in the machine, as freedom of expression and information is not a
matter of robots. Covid-19 related disinformation may serve economic
purposes and political purposes and it is crucial to fight it so that
the pandemics comes to an end as soon as possible but that in the
meantime civil liberties are not gone way with Covid-19. 

### Portugal (b)

In my view, it is urgent to activate the strengthening of community
outreach intervention, innovating spaces for meeting and social
coexistence.\
Reinforce environmental and ecological sustainability programs related
to the ways of life of populations and communities.\
Contribute to the flexibilization of home space for the most vulnerable
groups by reducing situations of violence and conflict.

**Serbia**

1.  State authorities should work on raising awareness of the dangers of
    disinformation and promote the use of authoritative sources. They
    should support the activities of independent fact-checking
    organizations.

2.  The platforms should ensure that content moderators are in place to
    complement technological solutions and cooperate with local actors
    to confront Covid-19 related disinformation. In line with corporate
    social responsibility, the platforms should adopt a self-regulatory
    framework concerning Covid-19 related information’s politics.

3.  Civil society should investigate cases of the Covid-19 related
    disinformation through platforms and notify both state actors and
    the platforms about established cases. Besides, NGOs should support
    studies on freedom of expression and its limitations and make an
    effort to catch the platforms’ attention.

**South Africa**

a\) There is a plethora of regulations, some of them contradictory, and
often interpreted differently by different authorities. This was
particularly problematic in the stricter stages of the lockdown, when
police were arresting individuals for conduct that was not rendered
criminal under the regulations themselves. While the government has
acknowledged and attempted to address some of the contradictions, the
sheer volume and complexity of the regulations have made it difficult or
impossible for people to comply with them. In this way, misinformation
is almost built into the regulations themselves. So, we would recommend
a thorough overhaul of the regulations to ensure transparency and
consistent interpretation of the applicable rules. We also recommend
that the SA government monitor compliance with, and enforce its own
regulations requiring social media platforms to remove misinformation.

b\) Platforms need to use more sophisticated misinformation detection
algorithms than the prevailing "blacklisted" terms approach. In
particular, platforms should be more sensitive to satire, genuine
disagreement, speculation on questions that do not yet have definitive
scientific answers, and commentary on fake news. Furthermore, given the
inexactitude of misinformation detection, there needs to be more
transparency in the algorithms being used, and an appeals process for
takedowns. That way platform users who are committed to combatting
misinformation can trust the system and effectively form part of a
"crowd sourced" body of fact checkers and people who will not re-share
dubious claims.[^504]

c\) Civil society should act to enhance the public understanding of
Covid-19 and pressure the state for more transparency in the regulation
process and more disclosure of the data underlying policy decisions
being made. Civil society should also more clearly draw the line between
evidence and policy conclusions and avoid the temptation to argue that
opposing a policy which is based on sound evidence is tantamount to
rejecting the evidence itself - as this opens the floodgates for
political disagreement to spill over into misinformation.

**Spain**

a\) **Authorities** must be responsible and implementation of combined
non-legislative and legislative measures to combat disinformation should
be taken. Legislation should regulate (as the French Law - Loi organique
n° 2018-1201 du 22 décembre 2018 relative à la lutte contre la
manipulation de l'information, for example):

- The implementation of an accessible and visible reporting mechanism;

- The transparency of algorithms; the promotion of content from press
and news agencies and from audio-visual communication services;

- The fight against accounts disseminating false information on a
massive scale;

- The information to the users on the nature, origin and modalities for
dissemination of content;

- The identity of individuals providing remuneration in return for the
promotion of information content; and the promotion of media literacy.

In Spain, a recommendation was adopted in March 2018 by the Joint
Cybersecurity Working Group on misinformation and election
misinformation. Despite being non-binding, the Committee asked the
government to cooperate with the EU in developing strategies against
misinformation.

**b)** If **platforms** do not want to be responsible for the content
uploaded by their users, they are required to prevent the availability
of content that infringes on copyrights. This duty should be understood
as an imposition of content filters, both because of their suitability
to control large amounts of content, due to the background and
preparatory documents of the DAMUD[^505] and the very wording of Article
17 DAMUD). See also: Recommendation 2018/334 European Commission, 1
March 2018, measures against illegal content. Governments must finance
research regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI) to avoid disinformation.
In this regard, consideration may be given to a research project funded
by BBVA Foundation: Intelligent characterization of the veracity of
information associated with COVID-19.

**c)** **Civil society** must act in a responsible way; it must hold
authorities accountable for being respectful with the laws.

**Latvia**

Prevailing themes in disinformation, misinformation, and conspiracy
theories during the Covid-19: Latvian case analysis. Available:
<https://www.lai.lv/viedokli/prevailing-themes-in-disinformation-misinformation-and-conspiracy-theories-during-the-covid-19-pande-855>

In Summer 2020 the students of Political Science from the University of
Latvia carried out research the how the Latvian society views the
Covid-19 pandemic. The study, the summary of which can be found online
(https://zurnalsiepirkumi.lv/lu-politikas-zinatnes-studenti-prezentes-petijumu-par-latvijas-sabiedribas-skatijumu-uz-covid-19-pandemiju/)
points to some important tendencies. For example, approximately 70% of
respondents indicated that they learned about current events from social
networks and Internet portals; half of those surveyed noted that the
government and the World Health Organization might be hiding some
important information and slightly more than half of the respondents
indicated that they had encountered misinformation or conspiracy
theories in connection with the Covid-19 crisis. Typically the
respondents had encountered such information on Facebook. The results of
the study will be summarised in a book that will be available to the
general public next year; however, it must be noted that the study only
reflects the time till July, while the real "wave" of pandemics and
infodemics in Latvia started only in autumn.

### Lithuania

The Covid-19 Management Strategy adopted by the Government of Lithuania
on 10/06/2020 contains a chapter on informing the public and combating
fake news, see
https://lrv.lt/uploads/main/documents/files/Covid\_19%20valdymo%20strategija\_EN.pdf,
p. 6-7 (and its implementation plan in Lithuanian language here
https://koronastop.lrv.lt/uploads/documents/files/Covid-19%20valdymo%20strategijos%20planas.pdf
, 1.7).

**Moldova**

In my view, alongside with the above mentioned, the following sources
could serve as further research tracks:

To my mind, the Disinformation Resilience Index[^506] and COVID-19
Disinformation Response Index 2020[^507] delivered by the Foreign Policy
Council “Ukrainian Prism”, are of particular interest, specifically for
the case of R. Moldova.

Thus, according to the 2018 Report[^508], in the Republic of Moldova,
there are three major initiatives to expose and combat disinformation,
including one that deals with reporting fake social media accounts used
for promoting hostile narratives.

One of the first and the most significant initiative is the **‘Stop
Fals!’ campaign** initiated by the Association of Independent Press
(API). Through this project, API aims to build the capacities of
independent media and its network of member-constituents through
specialized service provision. As a strange sign of the project’s
success, we can point to a fake (imitation) site called stopfals.com
that appeared, promoting false debunking stories on the web under the
real project’s brand. It is important to mention that ‘Stop False’ has
chosen not to limit itself to the web and disseminates its findings to
local newspapers to reach a broader audience that does not necessarily
have the access or skills to use the internet.

Unfortunately, the campaign only deals with local content. This limits
the capability of the campaign to fight against all the pro-Kremlin
narratives concerning the Republic of Moldova that come from original
Russian sources, and sometimes even Western media. This project can be
best described as a useful tool to monitor local media and promote ‘fake
news’ awareness culture in the country.

**The Sic.md project** has ambitious goals to identify lies,
inaccuracies and manipulations in public impact statements and inform
citizens in a simple and accessible way. Sic.md also deals with
monitoring the public promises of politicians as well as notifying
breaches of ethics in media and public declarations.

The website has a very user-friendly interface. The team strives to have
daily posts that represent a synthesis of the day and long reads on
complex issues linked to media manipulation. The website also has a
report section for a user to email the debunking team.

Among the limitations of this initiative is that it is limited to one
website, compared to ‘Stop Fals!’, which publishes its articles on
several websites and newspapers. Additionally, it does not have a
developed communications component, most likely because of a lack of
resources. Sic.md also can be considered a tool for political
accountability, including for pro-Kremlin politicians’ declarations,
which expands its coverage compared to the ‘Stop Fals!’ campaign.

**The TROLLESS project** was developed during the 2nd Media Hackathon
‘The Fifth Power’, organized by the Centre for Independent Journalism
and Deutsche Welle Akademie. The primary purpose of the project, a
browser extension, is to identify the sources of manipulation in new
social media spaces and to isolate them.

The extension helps track false profiles or those who display suspicious
or trolling activity on Facebook and other platforms. Users can report
them for promoting interests, parties, ideas, causes, misinformation,
manipulation, and distraction. This does not affect the availability of
the fake accounts, but the people using the extension can see that those
accounts have been reported and can analyze the situation accordingly.
In 2018 The Trolless community had more than 800 users on the Chrome
platform, and the authors were considering extending it to other
platforms like Mozilla or Safari. This project deals exclusively with
social media and is only available to users who have installed the
extension in Google Chrome.

The number of digital-debunking teams in Moldova is insufficient because
of the limited resources available for this type of activity. All depend
on foreign financial support and may not be sustainable for the long
term if this support stops. According to the authors of the projects,
the state has not shown interest in developing such initiatives and
generally ignores the results of their activity.[^509]

Also I would suggest to capitalize on the research conducted by:

In academia there are studies on the issue of how Covid-19 has been
dealt with by media and social networks, such as for ex. the study of
the MediaLad on the presence of the theme “Coronavirus” in Google

greater emphasis in the 30 days before March 2, the day on which the
first cases of the disease in Portugal were officially confirmed.\

**Making Sense of Conspiracy Theories**[^511]

Peter Knight Clare Birchall

UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER KINGS’S COLLEGE LONDON

Most conspiracy thinking does not create brand new theories, but instead
assembles speculations out of existing narratives, images and fears.
Like viruses themselves, conspiracy theories adapt to new environments,
mutating and recombining strands of cultural DNA. People who already
view the world through a lens of a conspiracy theory quickly interpret
current events as a part of that conspiracy. This is what is happening
with the coronavirus pandemic. In these theories the identity and
ultimate goal of the conspiracy is often hazy and shifting, but the
basic story is that the pandemic is part of a much larger plot by a
group of unaccountable and secretive elites who have been in control of
events for decades, perhaps even centuries. This is one of the main
narrative formulae of conspiracy theories, and we’ve seen versions of
this before, from stories about the Illuminati, to recurrent outbursts
of antisemitism. As with most conspiracy theories, the coronavirus
accusations often make a large, speculative leap from some known facts
to draw a seemingly surprising conclusion, but a conclusion that is
often known in advance. Unlike scientific theories that test a
hypothesis against new evidence, conspiracy theories often go in search
of factoids that will “confirm” an existing conclusion. Yes, for
example, the Gates Foundation did provide funding to the Pirbright
Institute in the UK to aid its work on a vaccine for a strain of
coronavirus that affects livestock poultry; and yes, Gates has long
advocated and funded vaccination programmes for the world’s poor, and
has taken a keen interest in promoting preparedness for potential
pandemics, including a scenario-planning exercise coordinated by Johns
Hopkins University in October 2019 that modelled an outbreak of a flu
virus. But neither of these verified facts warrants the conclusion that
Gates is the mastermind of a fiendish conspiracy to institute mind
control or genocide on the world’s population.

Alongside billionaire philanthropists such as Bill Gates and George
Soros (with the latter often a dog-whistle call to antisemitic
theories), the conspiracy theorists sometimes blame actual global
institutions like the United Nations and World Health Organisation, as
well as imaginary ones such as the Illuminati (who were a real secret
society of students promoting Enlightenment philosophy in Bavaria in the
late eighteenth century, but who disappeared after they were banned by
the authorities after little over a decade in existence). The sprawling
community of QAnon believers – at first in the US, but now spreading
rapidly in various European countries including the UK – soon wove the
emergence of COVID-19 into their existing conspiracy fantasy: a lurid
theory that a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophiles – encompassing the
so-called “Deep State,” leading Democrats, the mainstream media and the
Hollywood elite – is secretly controlling the world. They are convinced
that President Trump is fully aware of what is happening, and, when the
prophesised moment is right, will unleash a second civil war (the
“Coming Storm”), leading to the arrest and execution of all the enemies.
The whole plot is supposedly being revealed in a series of cryptic
messages posted on fringe online message boards inhabited by the
alt-right by a figure called Q, an anonymous whistle-blower working with
the intelligence agencies with top-level security clearance. The
followers of Q obsessively speculate on the meaning of these obscure
clues, that read as if they are a spoof of spy talk gleaned from trashy
thrillers, but now increasingly wrapped up in the language of
evangelical prophesy. The pandemic has added fuel to the flames of the
QAnon conspiracy theory, drawing more people into the online community
that then began to spill over into real-world anti-lockdown
demonstrations.

Hosted on libertarian, wilfully politically incorrect and deeply
misogynistic platforms like 4Chan and 8kun, QAnon has since its
emergence in 2017 allowed its followers to indulge in masculinist
fantasies of armed resistance to those they view as an unpatriotic
elite. Yet with the coronavirus pandemic this alt-right conspiracy
community has begun to converge with the New Age wellness community.
These new converts, many of whom are women, are concerned that the
pandemic will lead to mandatory vaccination programmes. Their Instagram
posts are not the hate-filled, sexist, racist and sarcastic memes that
are the staple of alt-right message boards, but instead offer
tear-jerking calls to \#savethechildren from the evil conspiracy of
paedophiles, all in pastel colours.

What are we to make of these conspiracy theories? As Hollywood films
have long recognised, part of the appeal of conspiracy thinking is that
dizzying, exhilarating moment of panic that even the hardened sceptic
can succumb to: what if it’s all true? What if everything we are told is
a lie? For most people, however, that initial moment of conspiracy rush
subsides. For those who are not true believers, it is then tempting to
dismiss conspiracy theories as, at best, cynical shit-posting, or, at
worst, the delusional ravings of a dangerous political fringe. But
conspiracy theories are widespread, and they matter. Surveys show that
most people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory. In the case
of the coronavirus pandemic, roughly a quarter of people in the UK and
the US believe that the pandemic was deliberately planned, for example.
And belief is connected to behaviour. At the extreme end, in the UK and
other European countries there were over a hundred attacks on mobile
phone masts. Perhaps more worrying, a third of respondents in surveys
say that they would refuse a COVID-19 vaccination, even if it had been
approved as safe.

Why do people believe in conspiracy theories? How do conspiracy theories
work? And what should we do about them?

There are three cardinal rules of conspiracy theory: nothing is as it
seems; nothing happens by accident; and everything is connected.
Conspiracy theories provide alternative explanations of significant
happenings like wars, assassinations and plagues, and are usually
presented in opposition to received wisdom. In some countries and
regimes, however, they are the official version of events. Conspiracy
theories usually start from visible effects in the present, and
construct a story based on the conviction that someone deliberately
planned to bring those events about. That well-known philosopher of
history, Homer Simpson, concluded that “shit happens,” but the
conspiracy theorist insists that there are no accidents or coincidences
in history. Conspiracy theories ask “who benefits?,” and work their
backwards to identify the conspirators who must therefore have planned
everything. If the coronavirus pandemic is likely to lead to some
pharmaceutical companies making big profits by selling vaccines, the
logic is that they must have planned it in advance. Conspiracy theories
often (but not always) are populist in outlook, seeing history as a
struggle between the innocent people and the corrupt elites, by-passing
the usual structures of party politics. In general, they divide the
world into a battle between good and evil, insiders and outsiders, Us vs
Them, finding convenient scapegoats to blame for complex problems. In
some cases conspiracy theories serve to forge a sense of community:
QAnon believers can resemble a cult at times, for example, and
particular online conspiracy spaces can generate a powerful sense of
being one of the enlightened few who are in-the-know. But often that
sense of community and identity is constructed by blaming other groups
for social ills. In more extreme versions, the conspirators are
portrayed as evil and subhuman, who will stop at nothing to achieve
their devilish plans. Conspiracy theories are frequently apocalyptic in
tone, insisting urgently that the future of the nation or the liberty of
the people hangs by a thread.

Conspiracy theories are often accused of simplifying complex events.
It’s true that they do tend to create simplistic overarching
explanations. But at the level of detail, conspiracy theories often end
up constructing phenomenally complicated accounts. One reason they do
this is because they start from the assumption that everything is
connected: even seemingly unconnected events and people are all part of
a fiendishly convoluted plot. Unlike scientific theories, conspiracy
theories are usually unfalsifiable. If you try and debunk them by
pointing to the lack of credible supporting evidence, the conspiracy
theorist will often claim that the lack of evidence is proof in itself:
the conspiracy is so all-powerful, the argument goes, that they have
managed to cover up any trace of their existence. If people in the
media, government or science seem to have evidence that undermines the
theory, then they must be shills for the conspiracy. In this way,
conspiracy theories become ever more elaborate, relentlessly
incorporating any conflicting evidence into an ever larger plot, even if
the fundamental story arc is depressingly simplistic and repetitive. For
this reason, it can be incredibly frustrating to argue against
conspiracy theorists, but you have to admire their ingenuity in
providing an answer to any conceivable objection. Making the situation
worse, conspiracy theorists often create a circular trail of reference:
when you follow up their obsessive footnotes and links, you quite often
find they refer to other conspiracy theorists, who in turn refer to
others, and so on in a circle of citation that creates a veneer of
credibility. What makes the situation more troubling now is that
conspiracy theories often suggest that traditional sources and
institutions of authoritative information – professional journalism, the
law, the civil service, governing officials, science – are all part of
the conspiracy. There is an increasing knee-jerk response to
delegitimise all forms of expertise as corrupt and self-serving. In this
situation, there is diminishing hope that appealing to facts and experts
will cut any ice with a committed conspiracy theorist.

Arguing against conspiracy theorists is difficult not just because of
the unfalsifiability of their views. It is also because in many cases
their beliefs are an expression of a deeply held worldview. In the same
way that people with a strong religious commitment often turn to
theological arguments to help rationalise their emotional investment in
their faith, so too do conspiracy theories serve as a way to justify
strong feelings of resentment and injustice. (And it therefore makes
sense that recognisably modern, all-encompassing conspiracy theories
begin to emerge in the late eighteenth century, at the moment when
religious belief in providence as an over-arching explanation of how
everything has been plotted by God began to wane.) Although for many
people flirting with conspiracy theories is no more than idle
speculation and or cynical provocation, for some committed believers a
conspiracist mindset is tied up with their life history and sense of
identity. Many QAnon and alt-right conspiracy believers, for example,
talk about “red pilling,” the moment when they came to feel that
everything the mainstream media are telling them is a lie. Changing your
mind about a conspiracy theory is therefore not simply a matter of
revising your opinion about a set of disputed facts in the light of new
evidence. It might mean unravelling your sense of who you are and how
the world works.

Although there can be a kernel of truth in most conspiracy theories,
they often make a speculative leap beyond what is warranted by the
evidence. But even if in a literal sense they might not be accurate,
that doesn’t mean that they are completely unhinged from reality. In
fact, in many cases conspiracy theories give voice to a distrust of the
authorities and the powerful that is understandable. Conspiracy rumours
about HIV/AIDS being created as a biowarfare agent to commit genocide on
the African American population are unfounded, for example, but they
speak to a long history of neglect on the part of the medical
establishment and the US government (the most notorious example being
the Tuskegee syphilis study, in which doctors continued to monitor the
long-term effects of syphilis in a group of black men, long after
antibiotic treatment for the disease became available). Likewise with
some coronavirus conspiracy theories, it is not unreasonable to have
concerns about vaccinations, or to have doubts about the government’s
approach to balancing the demands of health and economy in its response
to the pandemic, or even to have misgivings about the financial
incentives of multinational pharmaceutical companies. That doesn’t mean
that the specific allegations are true, but conspiracy theories
nevertheless often promise to explain What Is Really Going on.

The conspiracy theorist tends to adopt a stance of savvy, world-weary
cynicism, always expecting the worst of officials and experts, all too
ready to suspect anyone’s motives as corrupt. This default “hermeneutic
of suspicion” has much in common with the politically progressive
project of critique that also tries to delve beneath the confusion of
surface detail to find the real sources of power that shape our
societies. Indeed, many commentators have worried that precisely because
critique has come to resemble conspiracy theory it has run out of steam.
But at the same time the conspiracy theorist’s view of how history works
is oddly naïve – gullible even. It can end up distracting us from a more
convincing explanation of the world’s problems, and diverting political
energies from actually doing something about them. Where those trained
in social sciences see the complex interaction of social and economic
forces, powerful institutions, ideological persuasion and conflicts of
vested interests, the conspiracy theorist personifies those abstractions
and focuses instead on a story of the intentional actions of a small,
but hidden group of conspirators. For the social scientist, there is no
need for a conspiracy theory to explain why, for example, the 1% succeed
in shaping the world to their will. The elite as a social class with
shared interests openly pursue their transparent goals of
self-advancement, and it does not take a secret conspiracy of obscure
plotters for them to be able to achieve this. In addition, experience
suggests that what we’re witnessing with the pandemic is not the result
of some four-dimensional chess (whether by Dominic Cummings or the
Illuminati), but an omnishambles created by a government finding itself
serially out of its depth, convinced of its superior wisdom and
repeatedly resorting to cronyism.

Conspiracy theory, we might therefore say, functions as a form of pop
sociology, with the crucial difference that (in Michael Butter’s terms)
it engages either in deflection (it identifies the right issue, but
blames the wrong people) or distortion (it latches onto the right group
to blame, but for the wrong reasons). It is not surprising that the more
that people feel powerless in the face of political, financial and
technological vested interests, the more they turn to narratives
involving powerful but shadowy agents behind the scenes pulling the
strings. It might be scary and depressing to believe that there is a
vast, evil conspiracy secretly controlling events, but that can be oddly
comforting because it leaves open the possibility that the righteous
might one day take hold of the levers of power themselves. There’s a New
Yorker cartoon that sums up the position that a lot of us find ourselves
in. We know that there is probably not a vast conspiracy that has made
the world as fucked up as it is, but we can’t help shake the nagging
feeling that it sure looks as if someone planned it. The cartoon shows a
lone guy protesting on the street with a placard that reads, “We are
being CONTROLLED by random outcomes of a complex system.”

For some people conspiracy theories undoubtedly fulfil psychological
needs, especially in times of crisis, conflict or rapid social change.
The stories of how a particular individual came to embrace full-blown
conspiracism are regularly fascinating and moving. Psychologists now
tend to think that belief in conspiracy theories is not the product of
abnormal psychology, but the result of cognitive biases that we all
share to a greater or lesser extent, coupled with specific emotional and
social needs. We are attracted to explanations that promise to make
sense of the seeming randomness and complexity of current affairs; we
like to feel that we are one of the clever few who have managed to see
through the lies and manipulation; we are drawn to theories that make us
feel not so powerless; and we reach out for compelling accounts of why
our particular group or nation is being victimised. But these insights
into the psychological mechanisms at work downplay other social and
political reasons why sizeable numbers of people are attracted to
conspiracy thinking in particular historical moments. People believe in
conspiracy theories not (or, not merely) because they are misinformed or
stupid or crazy or their brains are hard-wired to see patterns, but
because conspiracy theories fulfil the need to find someone to blame for
genuine problems in society. However, we also now need to be alert to
the possibility that there are malicious groups (both foreign
disinformation units, and domestic political groups and alt-right
trolls) engaged in campaigns of so-called coordinated inauthentic
behaviour on social media to promote conspiracy theories and other forms
of “problematic information.” Often the motivation is not to champion
one particular alternative view but to sow the seeds of doubt about all
evidence, science and expertise. The aim of polluting the online
information environment is to increase distrust, stoke resentment and
destabilise society, and this might well be the most damaging effect of
online conspiracism.

Likewise, we need to think about the financial incentives of the
“conspiracy entrepreneurs” who make a healthy living from promoting
conspiracy theories, along with their side-line in snake-oil cures (e.g.
“Modern Miracle Solution” and “Colloidal Silver”). Professional
charlatans such as Alex Jones and David Icke make a living from peddling
their speeches, books and other merch, and it was no surprise to find
this latter veteran conspiracy-mongerer jumping on the bandwagon of the
coronavirus pandemic with his ready-made conspiracy explanations that
mix bizarre alien fantasies with all-too-familiar antisemitic myths.
Finally, we need to be alert to the possibility that sometimes
conspiracy theories are not the sincere expression of a deeply held
belief, but are a pragmatic, tactical stance that people adopt to help
bolster other positions they do genuinely believe. For example, research
has shown that climate change conspiracy theories are often used
strategically by those opposed to the political consequences of
recognising climate change as real. If you are as a matter of
ideological faith against government regulation of markets, then it’s
politically convenient to claim that climate scientists are corrupt and
it’s all a hoax.

The stereotypical picture of the conspiracy theorist is a socially
awkward guy in his parents’ basement, a keyboard warrior wearing a tin
foil hat. But research has shown that this clichéd portrait is not
entirely accurate. In general, men are no more likely to believe in
conspiracy theories than women, but it all depends on the particular
example. Surveys show that most hard-core moon landing conspiracy
theorists are men, for example, but anti-vaxxers are more likely to be
women. In a similar fashion, there’s not that much difference in general
between young and old, black and white, religious or not when it comes
to conspiracy belief, but once again it depends on the particular case.
The only significant difference comes with income and education: the
richer and the better educated you are, the less likely you are to
believe in conspiracy theories. In the case of coronavirus conspiracy
theories, for example, a recent survey in the US found that 48% of those
with only a high school level of education think it is probably or
definitely true that powerful people intentionally planned the COVID-19
outbreak, whereas only 15% of those with a postgraduate degree think
that is the case. The only other significant predictor is that if you
believe in one conspiracy theory, you tend to believe in many – which
makes sense, if you start from the conviction that everything is
connected.

But what about political belief: are those on the right wing more likely
to believe in conspiracy theories than those on the left? Again, it all
depends on context, not least where you live and what’s happening
politically. Belief in conspiracy theories is often partisan, with
people – unsurprisingly – more likely to believe in conspiracy theories
about the authorities when the party they identify with is not in power.
(The exception to this rule is Trump, of course, who promoted conspiracy
theories about Obama and Hillary Clinton when he was on the campaign
trail, but continued to do so while in office.) Research in a number of
countries indicates that in general conspiracy belief is higher at the
extreme ends of the political spectrum. However, there are reasons to
think that there is increasingly a connection between conspiracism and
right-wing politics. If you think that, as Ronald Reagan famously said,
government is the problem not the solution, then it stands to reason
that you might well view any encroachment of the “nanny state” into your
personal life as part of a bigger conspiracy to deprive you of your
freedoms.

Conspiracy theories have a long history, but have the internet and
social media made conspiracy theories go viral? There are good reasons
to think that the internet and conspiracy theory are made for one
another. Not only is it simple for anyone to distribute
professional-looking materials online with virtually no gate-keeping and
at incredible speed, but it is now easy to find a like-minded audience
in ways that were unthinkable in the past. Some commentators have
suggested that conspiracy theorists often become trapped in digital
“echo chambers” where they only engage with like-minded fellow
believers. This is coupled with the power of search engine results to
create a “filter bubble” effect, in which individuals only receive
information that reinforces their blinkered worldview. While this is
undoubtedly sometimes the case, the online world is far more diverse
than the filter bubble and echo chamber theories suggest. Search engine
results are rarely completely uniform, and online communities are seldom
totally immune to outside influence. People’s media diet is in reality
quite varied. When an echo chamber does emerge online, it is not
necessarily caused by the inherent nature of the technology itself but
by a process of social self-selection by participants that is also
visible in the offline world. Likewise, there is a tendency to
exaggerate the power of online communication, suggesting that viral
memes – like actual viruses – can take over the mind and body of a
vulnerable recipient, brainwashing them. Those who engage in online
conspiracy communities are far from passive, and we therefore need to
understand both their personal involvement but also the group dynamics
that particular platforms generate.

However, fuelled by the financial incentive of encouraging ever more
divisive, emotive and engaging content, the recommendation algorithms of
social media platforms can end up pushing some users down the rabbit
hole of radicalisation. With their seductive rhetoric, conspiracy
theories play a central role in this process. The social media companies
have been slow to acknowledge the role that their platform design
choices play in encouraging the spread of harmful misinformation and
hateful extremism, hiding behind the defence that their algorithms are
merely giving people more of what they like. But this ignores the
tendency of the recommendation algorithms to promote content that is
ever more extreme. In the case of Dylann Roof, who killed nine African
Americans in a church in Charleston in 2015, detectives were able to
reconstruct his browser history, showing his online journey into violent
white supremacism. In the face of a public outcry about this and other
mass shootings in which the gunman had clearly been heavily invested in
online racist conspiracy-mongering, social media platforms such as
YouTube began in 2019 to remove some conspiracist content and reduce its
prominence by changing their algorithm. With the coronavirus pandemic,
the platforms have taken a more proactive stance on content moderation,
removing material that promotes harmful medical information relating to
COVID-19. In October 2020, Facebook, for example, announced that it will
ban ads that merely discourage people from getting vaccinated,
tightening up their earlier ban on ads that actively promoted vaccine
misinformation. But the volume, speed and viral spread of misinformation
means that often the platforms are trying to close the stable door long
after the horse has bolted. Ultimately, their business model is based on
stoking controversy to generate engagement and advertising revenue, and
conspiracy theories fit the bill perfectly.

If, as we’ve been arguing, conspiracy theories are highly resistant to
correction, no amount of fact checking, flagging mechanisms and
promotion of accurate information on the part of the platforms are
likely to make much difference. Those approaches are just as likely to
make red-pilled conspiracy theorists dig in their heels, convinced that
Silicon Valley is itself part of the conspiracy to suppress the truth.
Conspiracy theories about the coronavirus are spreading not so much
because people are unable to access vital information, but because they
distrust official sources of information – even fact checkers. That
doesn’t mean we should give up on putting out correct information about
COVID-19 and linking to point-by-point debunking of conspiracy myths,
but we need a sense of realism that the facts won’t simply speak for
themselves and win the argument.

So, what can we do about conspiracy theories in the time of corona?
First, independent regulation of social media platforms is vital,
although we have to recognise that it is not a panacea, and it needs to
be nuanced. Outright deplatforming is sometimes necessary for content
that clearly promotes hatred and violence, but making borderline
problematic content harder to find or demonetising it might be enough to
help stop some stories going viral. One of the investigations we are
running on the Infodemic project is into the effectiveness of the
various changes that internet companies have introduced during the
pandemic. Social media platforms need to change their algorithms to
ensure that they are not actively promoting harmful conspiracy
materials, and they need to allow independent auditing of their
black-box technologies. Second, we need to choose which battles to
fight. Hard-core believers often make up only a small percentage of the
total number of those who show an interest in a conspiracy theory, and
they might well be a lost cause. It therefore makes more sense to engage
with people who don’t fully believe in a theory, but don’t fully
disbelieve in it either. Teaching analytical thinking skills and digital
media literacy are undoubtedly an important tool in the fight against
the pollution of the online information ecosystem, but they have their
limitations. For one thing, conspiracy theorists often seem to have
learned the lessons of information literacy all too well: they are the
first to cast suspicion on a story in the press, pointing out the vested
interests and the techniques of persuasion.

But this might give us our first way in. If you’re so sceptical, this
line of engagement goes, then maybe you need to be a bit more sceptical
about your own beliefs and sources of information, including taking a
closer look at the financial motives of conspiracy entrepreneurs, and
getting them to consider with a more sceptical eye what else would need
to be the case if there really was a secret cabal pulling the strings
behind the scenes as they claim. Of course, there is no guarantee that
this approach will have any effect, but it has the advantage of opening
up a conversation, rather than instantly descending into a face-off of
my facts against your facts. Establishing a sense of connection with a
conspiracy believer is crucial. Tempting though it is to ridicule anyone
willing to even entertain such ideas, we need to show a bit of empathy.
We need to understand that conspiracy theories can be a way for people
to give vent to a sense of grievance about the injustices of the world
(or, at the very least, their own situation in life). Those grievances
are often very real, even if the specific theories and scapegoats are
wide of the mark. Conspiracy theorists are often motivated by a sense of
justice or patriotism or anger that we all can identify with, even if we
think that their explanations of what is happening are completely
mistaken. We also need to recognise the pleasures and thrills of
conspiracy theorising, to try to understand why these kinds of story are
so appealing to so many people. It’s unlikely, however, that the
popularity of conspiracy theories is going to diminish unless people
have more reason to trust that we are all, genuinely, in this together.
