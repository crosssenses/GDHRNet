abstract:               "XXX This study, the fourth in a series conducted within the Global Digital Human Rights Network, focuses on the changes in (social) media governance after Russia’s attack on Ukraine. This study analyses how 29 states, including 18 EU members, have dealt with governing information flows related to the informational dimension of Russia’s war on Ukraine.\n

                        Based on questions answered by country rapporteurs, and analysis by a team of editors, this study shows a common approach by EU member states after the EU’s ban on Russian state-sponsored media. Non-EU-states tend to have a less vigorous response to Russian state-sponsored media.\n"
