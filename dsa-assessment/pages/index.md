title: Introduction and Methodology
:---------------------------------------------------------: 

The GDHRNet (Global Digital Human Rights Network) is dedicated to the investigation of theoretical and practical challenges of the protection of human rights in the digital context.  Platforms in particular face the challenge of organizing their services in a way that respects and protects the fundamental rights of their users.

Over recent years, the European legislator has introduced a comprehensive range of legal instruments, including the E-Commerce Directive[: REFERENCE | ref1 |:], the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[: REFERENCE | ref2 |:], as well as the Digital Services Act (DSA)[: REFERENCE | ref3 |:] and the Digital Markets Act (DMA)[: REFERENCE | ref4 |:], to effectively regulate the EU Digital Single Market.  The DSA in particular aims to ensure *"a safe, predictable and trustworthy online environment"*[: REFERENCE | ref5 |:] and therefore stipulates in its Article 14 (4) the obligations for platforms to take the fundamental rights of their users into account.

In light of the above-mentioned this study examines the obligations for platforms in 9 GDHRNet-member states, including 7 EU-member states, to ensure the protection of fundamental rights. Based on the responses to a questionnaire by country rapporteurs, and the analysis conducted by the editors, this study has two outcomes which are at the same time the Milestones of the GDHRNet for 2024: 

- The development of guidelines for platforms to offer and carry out their online activities in accordance with fundamental rights (Milestone 1)

- and secondly, the creation of an assessment model to evaluate the compliance of platform services regarding the protection of human rights (Milestone 2).

This document entails part 2 of the study (Assessment model for states). The aim of the study was to develop the foundations of an assessment model for assessing the compliance of online companies regarding human rights protection obligations. An [executive summary](#heading-8) recapitulates the main results of the study. The findings of the study have been built into the [foundations of an assessment model](#heading-16). The study builds upon a questionnaire focusing on national platform oversight structures that has been sent out to GDHRNet members. To each question, there is a [summary entailing the relevant information provided by GDHRNet members](#contributions). The scope of the study is limited to the GDHRNet members’ responses to the questionnaire. No additional information has been added.

title: Executive Summary
:---------------------------------------------------------: 

- Nine GDHRNet members participated in the survey. Of these participants, seven report on EU member states (Austria, Cyprus, Czechia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Portugal), and two on non-EU member states (Moldova, and Serbia).

- A Digital Services Coordinator (DSC) – which is the supervisory authority to be established under the DSA – has been appointed in Austria, Czechia, Cyprus, Finland, Germany, Italy and Portugal.

- Where a DSC has been designated, the state reports indicate that existing authorities overseeing telecommunication and/or media authorities have been chosen to function as DSC. 

- Most reports show that the national DSCsy are sufficiently equipped, but the report on Czechia indicates a lack of staff, while the report on Cyprus indicates limited financial resources.

- DSCs are granted sufficient power to request data from service providers. The reports show that national legislation is closely oriented on the requirements the DSA sets out.

- Under the DSA, sanctions are to be imposed by the member states in cases of DSA infringements by service providers. In those states where such legislation is in place, it closely follows DSA requirements (especially regarding the maximum amount). 

- Reports on Finland, Italy, and Austria show that DSCs are required to cooperate with other authorities within their state, but also with other national DSCs. For example, the Austrian DSC is required to regularly interact and exchange their opinions and experiences regarding certain topics with other DSCs.

title: Foundations for an Assessment Model
:---------------------------------------------------------: 

For **Milestone 2 (Assessment Model)** GDHRNet members develop the foundations of an assessment model for assessing the compliance of online companies regarding human rights protection obligations. In the EU, national authorities are required to assess online companies regarding obligations under the Digital Services Act: The DSA contains specific regulatory mandates directed at Member States. Accordingly, a Digital Services Coordinator (DSC) is to be established in each Member State as a new supervisory authority, which is to receive complaints from users from the respective Member State and ensure access to the data of the intermediary services.

The assessment model is built upon a questionnaire which allowed to gather information on the assessment of online companies by these national authorities (DSCs). The analysis of the reports on the questionnaire by GDHRNet members allowed to compile this list of requirements and considerations for a human rights-based assessment of online companies:

### Designation of an already existing national authority in the field of media and/or telecommunication regulation.

The report showed that member states rely on already existing authorities to assess online companies. This allows them to draw on preexisting experience and knowledge in the field of media and/or telecommunications as well as preexisting structures within the authority.

### Guarantees of independence of the national authority, including the allocation of sufficient resources.

While there were no specific reports about the (lack of) independence of any national authority, the reports showed a common concern about guarantees of independence, proving the independence of national authorities essential for human rights-based assessment of online companies. This goes hand-in-hand with the allocation of sufficient technical, financial, and human resources, which are a prerequisite for the performance of any assessment.

### Coordination with other national authorities.

Under the DSA, many GDHRNet member states are required to designate a DSC. This leads to a lot of experience spread across different authorities. Coordination between these authorities is essential in order to share this information and knowledge. This coordination should be legally established.

### Involvement of civil society

The assessment of online companies should be carried out with the involvement of civil society. This allows national authorities to draw on the valuable experiences and perspectives of civil society organizations. For example, such involvement can be carried out through an advisory board.

### Development of risk assessment mechanism and an information security strategy

The report showed that various GDHRnet member states have implemented cybersecurity frameworks and risk assessment mechanisms to address threats from digital platforms and protect national security. These efforts are complemented by EU-wide regulations like the DSA or the NIS 2 Directive and crisis management structures designed to enhance the resilience of digital services and mitigate cyber risks. The national regulatory bodies of the GDHRnet member states should cooperate and develop guidelines in relation to specific risks.

### Access to data

When assessing online companies, access to data is crucial. Only if sufficient information about the rules and processes of online companies is available, an assessment can be performed successfully. Access to data shall be legally established.

### Transparency about content moderation and advertising

Besides data access, transparency about content moderation processes and advertising is essential to enable an effective evaluation of the compliance of online companies regarding human rights obligations. The report indicates that a range of GDHRNet member states, also non EU-members, have already implemented transparency requirements for platforms into their legal framework.

### Cooperation with Trusted Flaggers

Under the DSA, platforms are allowed to cooperate with trusted flaggers. The Trusted flagger status is granted by the DSC of the member state and the status is designated to organizations which demonstrate expertise in handling illegal content and operate with diligence and objectivity. Platforms benefit from the cooperation with trusted flaggers and therefore can address illegal content more effectively. Platform shall collaborate with trusted entities under legal frameworks to address harmful content.
