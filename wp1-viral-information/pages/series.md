# GDHRNet Working Paper Series

The Working Papers of the [Global Digital Human Rights Network](https://gdhrnet.eu/) – edited by Matthias C. Kettemann and Martin Fertmann – contain both an idealistic and a practice-oriented dimension. Scholars working with digital human rights have for some time realized that in the digital domain of human rights theory matters less and technical solutions matter more. The Working Paper series attempts to reverse this pattern and with the Network’s capability looks to to break or at least question the strengthening grip of the online companies as powerful actors in defining the image of human rights in the digital landscape.

The publication is based upon work from COST Action GDHRNet – CA19143, supported by [COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology)](www.cost.eu). Our Actions help connect research initiatives across Europe and enable scientists to grow their ideas by sharing them with their peers. This boosts their research, career and innovation.

## Global Digital Human Rights Network

The [GDHRNet COST Action](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA19143/) will systematically explore the theoretical and practical challenges posed by the online context to the protection of human rights. The network will address whether international human rights law is sufficiently detailed to enable governments and private online companies to understand their respective obligations vis-à-vis human rights protection online. It will evaluate how national governments have responded to the task of providing a regulatory framework for online companies and how these companies have transposed the obligation to protect human rights and combat hate speech online into their community standards. The matters of transparency and accountability will be explored, through the lens of corporate social responsibility.

:---------------------------------------:

The Action will propose a comprehensive system of human rights protection online, in the form of recommendations of the content assessment obligation by online companies, directed to the companies themselves, European and international policy organs, governments and the general public. The Action will also develop a model which minimizes the risk of arbitrary assessment of online content and instead solidifies standards which are used during content assessment; and maximizes the transparency of the outcome. 

The Action will achieve scientific breakthroughs (a) by means of a quantitative and qualitative assessment of whether private Internet companies provide sufficient protection of human rights online in comparison with judicial institutions, (b) in the form of a novel holistic theoretical approach to the potential role of artificial intelligence in protecting human rights online, and (c) by providing policy suggestions for private balancing of fundamental rights online. 


## COST Actions on COVID-19

**GDHRNet is a member of Network of COST Actions on COVID-19 and other pandemics.**

Very early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, COST Actions started to collaborate with other Actions on COVID-19 and on the impact of pandemics in general. In order to coordinate these efforts, COST has gathered details of all of the Actions wishing to connect and collaborate. All the information can be found in the booklet [“COST Actions against COVID-19 – An interdisciplinary network” ](https://www.cost.eu/who-we-are/about-cost/coronavirus-covid- 19).

As the full consequences of the current pandemic are yet unknown and the threat of a future pandemic is always present, the Network of Actions offers considerable potential in mobilising experts and tackling challenges as they arise. The Network is open to other participants and completely bottom-up. Any Actions wishing to join it can do so by contacting the COST Science Officer coordinating this initiative.
